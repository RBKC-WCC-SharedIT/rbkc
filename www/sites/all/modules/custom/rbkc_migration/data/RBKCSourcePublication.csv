Neighbourhood forums are community groups that are designated to take forward neighbourhood planning in areas without parishes, as in the case of the Royal Borough.</p> <p>A Neighbourhood Forum is an organisation that is established to promote the social, economic and environmental well-being of an area and has membership which is open to people who live, work and those who are elected to represent the area concerned.</p> <p>Prospective Neighbourhood Forums must apply to the Council to be designated.</p> <h2>What is a Neighbourhood Area?</h2> <p>A Neighbourhood Area is the geographical area that a Neighbourhood Plan or a Neighbourhood Development Order covers. The Neighbourhood Area must be designated by the Council and there cannot be more than one Neighbourhood Plan relating to a Neighbourhood Area, and areas cannot overlap.</p> <p>Prospective Neighbourhood Forums must apply to the Council for a Neighbourhood Area to be designated. This application can be made at the same time as, or separately from, an application to be a Neighbourhood Forum.</p> <h2>What is a Neighbourhood Plan?</h2> <p>A Neighbourhood Plan sets out policies in relation to development and use of land in a particular Neighbourhood Area. Neighbourhood Plans are not developed by the Council but they do have to be in general conformity with Council&rsquo;s Core Strategy and the London Plan. They are intended to be tools for positive planning, not a way of preventing development and in particular they cannot introduce controls that are additional to existing planning law and regulations.<br /> Following consultation and examination a Neighbourhood Plan would be approved if it<br /> received more than 50% of the votes cast in a referendum.</p> <h2>What is a Neighbourhood Development Order?</h2> <p>A Neighbourhood Development Order sets out the type of development that can take<br /> place a particular Neighbourhood Area without the need for a planning application to be<br /> made.</p> <p>As with Neighbourhood Plans, Neighbourhood Development Orders would be subject to<br /> consultation, examination and a referendum before they are approved.<br /></p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-nextName"><a href="ILINK|15612,|">Is a Neighbourhood Plan right for you</a></div>]]></paginationbox><HEAD xmlns=""><![CDATA[<style>   .internalTOC li:first-child { position:relative; z-index: 1; }  .internalTOC li:first-child a { color:#5E6A77; position:relative; z-index: 100; }  .internalTOC li:first-child a:hover {  background: none  #FFF; cursor: default;  }   @media only screen and (min-width: 700px) {   .internalTOC li:first-child a { border-bottom: solid #DDD 1px; }   .internalTOC li:first-child { background: transparent url(/images/refresh/contents_UR_here.png) no-repeat 100% 50%; padding: 0 11px 0 0; /* SP */ width:100%;  border-bottom: none; }  }   </style>]]></HEAD></content></page_data>$,$Guide to Neighbourhood planning$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Planning and Building Control$,,,,$Neighbourhood Planning Guide$,en,planningandbuildingcontrol/neighbourhoodplanning/neighbourhoodplanningguide.aspx,$Guide to Neighbourhood Planning$,$Guide to Neighbourhood planning$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Guide to Neighbourhood planning$,,,rf-pub-parent,4254

A neighbourhood plan is a planning policy document. It would be one of a suite of policy documents against which planning applications in your local area would be assessed. So you need to think about your aims and ambitions and whether these can be delivered through planning policy.</p> <p>Neighbourhood Planning is optional so you should not feel your area will miss out if it<br /> does not have a Neighbourhood Plan. The Council&rsquo;s Core Strategy has identified and<br /> planned for a number of &lsquo;places&rsquo;, these may be sufficient in themselves or they can be<br /> built upon with neighbourhood plans.</p> <p>The Council has a number of other means of getting involved in making improvements<br /> in your local area like <a href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/citylivinglocallife">City Living Local Life</a>&nbsp;or Conservation Area Appraisals which may be an easier way to make a difference in your area. A Neighbourhood Plan is produced by local people, not the local authority. This can be time consuming and resource intensive so you need to be realistic about what you might be undertaking.</p> <p>Just as the Council is required to consult when preparing policy<br /> and development plans, it is essential that community groups do the same to ensure<br /> that the neighbourhood plan expresses the wishes of the whole community.</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a title="Neighbourhood planning guide" href="ILINK|15528,|">Neighbourhood Planning Guide</a></div> <div class="pagName-nextName"><a href="ILINK|15613,|">Support the Council provides</a></div>]]></paginationbox></content></page_data>$,$Neighbourhood planning$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Planning and Building Control$,,,,$Neighbourhood Plan for you$,en,planningandbuildingcontrol/neighbourhoodplanning/neighbourhoodplanningguide/neighbourhoodplanforyou.aspx,$Is a Neighbourhood Plan right for you?$,$Neighbourhood planning$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Neighbourhood planning$,,,rf-pub-child,4293

Decision to designate an area or forum</strong></h2> <p class="MsoNormal">This is a decision based on responses to formal consultation undertaken by the Council and is likely to have a 'significant impact on the community'&nbsp;so will be a Key Decision taken by the Cabinet Member for Planning or the Cabinet.</p> <h2><strong>3. Decision to publicise a neighbourhood plan</strong></h2> <p class="MsoNormal">When a draft neighbourhood plan is submitted to the Council, the Council is responsible for checking the neighbourhood plan has met the requirements and includes each of the documents referred to in the regulations. These are matters of fact and as such will be delegated decisions taken by the Executive Director of Planning and Borough Development.</p> <h2><strong>4. Decision to submit a neighbourhood plan for examination</strong></h2> <p class="MsoNormal">The Council is responsible for checking that the submitted Neighbourhood Plan has followed the proper legal process, such as the neighbourhood area being designated and that the plan has met the legal requirements for consultation and publicity. These are matters of fact, but as this is also a significant decision in the process following which the Council will have limited opportunities to reject a plan at a later stage this will be a Key Decision taken by the Cabinet Member for Planning or the Cabinet.</p> <h2><strong>5. Decision to adopt a neighbourhood plan after examination and referendum</strong></h2> <p class="MsoNormal">Although there are limited grounds on which a decision can be taken to refuse to adopt/make a neighbourhood plan there still needs to be a decision and the reasons for that decision given. Section 38A(6) of the PCPA 2004 provides that the Council is not subject to the duty to make a plan following a referendum in favour of adoption if it considers that the making of the plan would breach or be incompatible with an EU obligation or Convention rights. In view of this the decision to adopt a neighbourhood plan will be a Key Decision taken by the Cabinet Member for Planning or the Cabinet.</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|15614,|">What happens next</a></div>]]></paginationbox><content xmlns=""><![CDATA[]]></content></content></page_data>$,$How the Council will make decisions about Neighbourhood Plans$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Planning and Building Control$,,,,$Council decisions$,en,planningandbuildingcontrol/neighbourhoodplanning/neighbourhoodplanningguide/councildecisions.aspx,$How the Council will make decisions$,$How the Council will make decisions about Neighbourhood Plans$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$How the Council will make decisions about Neighbourhood Plans$,,,rf-pub-child,4377

The licence allows the child to perform either in: theatre, filming, modelling, voice over, commercials etc. There are a number of different legislations that apply to entertainment performances. They include:</p> <p>Children and Young Persons Act 1933</p> <p>Children and Young Persons Act 1963;</p> <p>Children (Performances) Regulations 1968; (Amended 1998 and 2000)</p> <p>Television Act 1964;</p> <p>1.2 A child will need a licence before they can accept perform;</p> <p>1.3 The purpose of the licence is to ensure that all children are adequately safeguarded and supported.</p> <h3>2) Guidance</h3> <p>2.1 The Attendance (statutory), Child employment and entertainment, Elective home education and children missing education service (ACE) will consider a number of standards that the licence holder must meet before a licence can be issued.</p> <p>2.2 Where a child will be absent from school to perform, the Head or Deputy Headteacher at the child&rsquo;s school must consent to the absence and provide a letter to the licensing authority. The school is consenting to authorising the child&rsquo;s absence for the agreed period for which the licence cover. Under the regulations, such absence must be recorded in the school register as authorised using registration code: C</p> <p>2.3 The licensing authority shall not grant a licence unless they are satisfied that the child's education will not suffer. Where a school declines to consent to a child&rsquo;s absence, they must be able to prove to the LA that the child&rsquo;s education will suffer as a result of being absent to engage in a performance. The school may demonstrate this by for example, missing homework, slipping grades, inability to catch up on work, missing additional days due to tiredness or unexplained absences etc. If this is the case the Children in Entertainment Officer will refuse the application.</p> <p>Where a school has raised concerns with the LA&rsquo;s school support officer regarding frequency of absence to attend performances and auditions the Officer may make contact with the agency / applicant to request that future appointments are offered outside school time.</p> <p>2.4 Any school absence due to an unlicensed performance will be recorded as an unauthorised absence on the child&rsquo;s attendance record.</p> <p>2.5 A tutor must be supplied, where appropriate, on longer productions. The tutor must be registered with a licensing authority and hold valid Disclosure &amp; Barring Service (DBS) checks. It is the responsibility of the licence holder to negotiate educational arrangements/support with the headteacher prior to the licence application.</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|16816,|">Child Employment Overview</a></div> <div class="pagName-nextName"><a href="ILINK|16573,|">Restrictions to performances</a></div>]]></paginationbox><HEAD xmlns=""><![CDATA[]]></HEAD></content></page_data>$,$Children in Entertainment Overview$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Education and learning$,,,,$Children in Entertainment$,en,schools/attendancechildemployment/acechildemployment/childreninentertainment.aspx,$Children in Entertainment Overview$,$Children in Entertainment Overview$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$entertainment, employment, child, children,$,,,rf-pub-child,5019

Witness Statement</p> <p>a) The witness statement is a statement of facts of the case within a six month timescale. Statements must be brief and to the point. In terms of the rules of evidence, hearsay evidence is not permissible; therefore it is important that evidence is gathered by one person.</p> <p>b) Staff in Localities/Early Help services prepare a witness statement and are witnesses to the offence being committed.</p> <p>c) The witness statement needs to give details of parent/carers forenames as well as surnames.</p> <p>d) Distance can be used as a defence in proceedings by parent/carers.

School staff make the decision whether or not to authorise absences. Any absences that have been substantiated by a medical professional must be authorised and therefore cannot be used in evidence in proceedings for non- attendance.</p> <p>h) The witness statement must make reference to the reasons why a prosecution is being pursued as opposed to an application for an Education Supervision Order.</p> <p>i) Certificates of Attendance covering the period should be completed and signed by the head teacher of the school and submitted with the statement and referred to as &lsquo;Annexe 1&rsquo;.

LEGAL BASIS</p> <p>1.1 The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 s23 empowers designated Local Authority (LA) officers, head teachers (and deputy and assistant head teachers authorised by them), and the Police to issue penalty notices in cases of unauthorised absence from school.</p> <p>1.2 The Education (Penalty Notices) (England) Regulations 2004 came into force on 27th February 2004.</p> <p>1.3 The issuing of penalty notices must conform to all requirements of the Human Rights Act 2000 and all equal opportunities legislation.</p> <p>1.4 London Borough of Hammersmith &amp; Fulham (LBHF), Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea (RBKC) and City of Westminster (WCC) have the prime responsibility for developing the Code of Conduct within which all partners named in the Act will operate.</p> <p>1.5 In the three boroughs the ACE team is responsible for co-ordinating legal action in relation to school attendance.</p> <p>2. RATIONALE</p> <p>2.1 Regular and punctual attendance at school is both a legal requirement and essential for pupils to maximise their educational opportunities.</p> <p>2.2 In law an offence occurs if a parent or carer fails to secure a child&rsquo;s regular attendance at a school at which he or she is a registered pupil. Penalty notices supplement the existing sanctions to enforce attendance at school. These are to prosecute parents/carers (Education Act 1996 s444(1) &amp; 444 (1a)) or to apply for an Education Supervision Order, under the Children Act 1989 s36.</p> <p>2.3 Parent/carers and pupils are supported at school and Local Authority level to overcome barriers to regular attendance through a range of assessment and intervention strategies. Sanctions of any nature are for use only where parental co-operation in this process is either absent or deemed insufficient to resolve the presenting problem.</p> <p>2.4 Sanctions are used only as a means of enforcing attendance, where there is a reasonable expectation that their use will secure an improvement, and to emphasise the importance of parental responsibility.</p> <p>3. CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A PENALTY NOTICE MAY BE ISSUED</p> <p>3.1 The issue of a Penalty Notice may be considered in cases where a pupil is absent from school and the absence is unauthorised. Penalty Notices can be used by schools as an alternative to a referral to Localities Services and Early Help teams in LBHF, RBKC and WCC in cases of persistent non-attendance. The issue of a Penalty Notice may be considered appropriate in any of the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li>cases of overt truancy</li> <li>cases of parentally condoned absence, where this can be demonstrated</li> <li>instances where parents take children out of school for holidays/leave in term time, without the head teacher&rsquo;s approval</li> <li>instances of excessive delayed return from holidays/leave in term-time, without prior school agreement</li> <li>persistent lateness (unauthorised)</li> <li>where a child has been excluded from school and is found in a public place during school hours without reasonable justification within the first five days of the exclusion period</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;3.2 To ensure consistent and fair delivery of Penalty Notices within the Tri-borough, Penalty Notices will be considered in cases of unauthorised absence where:</p> <ul> <li>they are likely to be effective in improving attendance rates; and</li> <li>the pupil concerned has failed to attend school regularly over a six week period (when his/her attendance has fallen below 85%) and/or</li> <li>holiday/leave is deliberately taken in term time despite permission not being granted by school staff and holiday/leave amounted to 9.5 or more sessions, or</li> <li>holiday/leave in term-time has been agreed by school staff but pupil arrives back 9.5 or more sessions after the period agreed, or</li> <li>a&nbsp;holiday/leave in term-time was taken, no permission had been sought and the period of absences amounted to 9.5 or more sessions</li> </ul> <p>3.3 Where families include more than one pupil with poor attendance, multiple penalty notices may be issued, but this should be subject to careful consideration and co-ordination.</p> <p>3.4 For excluded pupils found in a public place during school hours, individual circumstances of each case must be carefully considered before a decision to issue a Notice. Reasons may include medical emergencies of parent or child, or pre-arranged medical appointment.</p> <p>4. PROCEDURE FOR ISSUING PENALTY NOTICES</p> <p>4.1 The Tri-borough ACE will implement the issuing of penalty notices on behalf of LBHF, RBKC and WCC under the authority of the Director of Children&rsquo;s Services to whom responsibility is delegated by law.</p> <p>4.2 The Tri-borough ACE will receive a fully completed referral form, with accompanying documentation, and consider written requests to issue penalty notices.</p> <p>This will ensure that there is;</p> <ul> <li>no duplication of notices being served</li> <li>a notice is not issued when legal proceedings are being contemplated under Education Act s444 or an application for an ESO is planned/being made</li> </ul> <p>4.3 Schools, the Metropolitan Police and neighbouring Local Authorities must consider every aspect of a pupil&rsquo;s case before judging whether or not to request the ACE to issue a penalty notice. This must include discussions with other agencies involved, including the Early Help and Locality Services and Social Care as well as any other attendance support staff who have knowledge of or involvement with the family before requesting a penalty notice.</p> <p>4.4 ACE will check that:</p> <ul> <li>all relevant information has been provided</li> <li>the circumstances of the pupil&rsquo;s absence meets all the requirements of this Code of Conduct</li> <li>the issue of a penalty notice does not conflict with other intervention strategies in place or other enforcement sanctions already being processed</li> <li>other support services are appropriately consulted.</li> </ul> <p>4.5 ACE will consider whether the issuing of a penalty notice is likely to improve attendance.</p> <p>4.6 ACE will consult neighbouring boroughs if a penalty notice is being considered for a parent/carer whose child attends a school in LBHF, RBKC and WCC but resides in another borough. This will ensure consistent and equitable delivery, retain school-home relationships and allow cohesion with other enforcement sanctions.</p> <p>4.7 Penalty notices will only be issued by post. Penalty notices will not be issued "on the spot" as this does not allow for the collation of evidence.</p> <p>4.8 ACE will respond to all requests within ten school days of receipt of a referral. If ACE decides that the threshold has been met for a penalty notice to be issued, it will:</p> <ul> <li>issue a Penalty Notice without warning from the Local Authority if a holiday/leave is taken without the school&rsquo;s permission, during term-time</li> <li>issue a formal written warning to the parent or carer of the possibility of a penalty notice being issued where the occurrence of absence is regular or persistent</li> <li>in the same letter set a period of 15 school days within which the pupil must have no more than 5 or more sessions of unauthorised absence</li> <li>issue a penalty notice at the end of the 15-day period if the required level of improvement has not been achieved</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>5. WITHDRAWAL OF PENALTY NOTICES</p> <p>ACE can only withdraw penalty notices in the following limited circumstances:</p> <p>5.1 Where it ought not to have been issued i.e. where it has been issued outside the terms of the local code of conduct or where no offence has been committed.</p> <p>5.2 Where it has been issued to the wrong person.</p> <p>6. PAYMENT OF PENALTY NOTICES</p> <p>6.1 Arrangements for payment will be detailed on the penalty notice.</p> <p>6.2 Payment of a penalty notice discharges the parents&rsquo; or carers&rsquo; liability for the period in question. This means that parents or carers cannot subsequently be prosecuted for their failure to ensure that their children are attending school regularly and punctually under other enforcement powers for the period covered by the penalty notice.</p> <p>6.3 Payment of a penalty notice within 21 days is &pound;60 and payment after this time but within 28 days is &pound;120. Failure to pay the fine after 28 days will result in consideration being given to prosecution in the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court.</p> <p>6.4 ACE retains any revenue from penalty notices to contribute to enforcement costs (collection or prosecution in the event of non-payment).</p> <p>7. NON-PAYMENT OF PENALTY NOTICES</p> <p>7.1 Cases of non-payment of a penalty notice, may trigger consideration of prosecution of parents/carers in the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court (Education Act 1996 s.444(1) &amp; 444 (1a)).</p> <p>8. COMMUNICATION AND PUBLICITY</p> <p>8.1 The establishment of this Code of Conduct should be made available to the school community of the schools intending to use penalty notices.</p> <p>8.2 In cases where penalty notices are being employed by schools, school attendance policies should be revised to include information on the deployment of penalty notices and this will be brought to the attention of all parents.</p> <p>8.3 ACE will provide a leaflet for schools to distribute to parent/carers explaining the use of penalty notices.</p> <p>9 REPORTING AND REVIEW</p> <p>9.1 ACE will report, as required, on the deployment and outcomes of penalty notices, along with other relevant information about attendance.</p> <p>9.2 ACE will review penalty notice use at regular intervals using information supplied by schools and propose amendments to the general enforcement strategy as appropriate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></topictext><contentsbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<h3>1.

Sanctions of this nature are for use only where parental co-operation is either absent or deemed insufficient to resolve the problem and are used as a means of enforcing attendance where it is likely that their use will secure an improvement. The key consideration in deciding whether or not to make an application to issue a PN, will be whether it will be effective in improving a child&rsquo;s attendance.</p> <p>A PN is an alternative to prosecution and will only be issued where the council is "able and willing" to prosecute (DCSF Guidance on Education Related Parenting Contracts, Parenting Orders and Penalty Notices, September 2007, para 186). Before a PN can be issued, Head Teachers and ACE team must be satisfied that the particular episode of unauthorised absence, looked at in the context of the individual child and his/her family, warrants criminal proceedings against the parents. They must also have considered alternative methods of securing attendance. The Tri-Borough PN Code of Conduct in London Borough Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea and City of Westminster allows only authorised officers of ACE to issue PNs. Police and Head Teachers should not issue PNs except in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>If accepted, the usual response to a first offence might be a warning letter rather than a penalty. However, authorised officers have the discretion to issue a PN for the first offence in circumstances. Once issued, a PN will incur a fine of &pound;60.00 per child if paid within 21 days of receipt of the notice, rising to &pound;120.00 per child if paid after 21 days but within 28 days of receipt. If the penalty is not paid in full by the end of the 28 day period, the Local Authority (LA) reserves the right to prosecute the parent(s) for the original offence of failing to secure the regular attendance of their child at their registered school, not for non-payment of the fine.</p> <p>The Tri-borough&rsquo;s PN Code of Conduct recommend issuing no more than "one Penalty Notice resulting from the unauthorised absence of an individual child in any twelve month period". However there may be cases where it is appropriate to issue more than one PN to a family during a 12-month period and these will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|16587,|">Penalty Notice Handbook overview</a></div> <div class="pagName-nextName"><a href="ILINK|16590,|">Circumstances</a></div>]]></paginationbox></content></page_data>$,$Key Considerations$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Education and learning$,,,,$Key Considerations$,en,schools/attendancechildemployment/penaltynoticehandbook/keyconsiderations.aspx,$Key Considerations$,$Key Considerations$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$child, children, employment$,,,rf-pub-child,5032

It is not a parental right to take leave during term time, the decision lies solely with the head teacher of the registered school. Parents must make a request for leave during term time giving the exceptional circumstances for the request and it is at the head teacher&rsquo;s discretion to determine whether that request should be granted.</p> <p>The head teacher must use their discretion, sparingly, and each request must be judged on a case-by-case basis. Head teachers should not fetter their discretion by applying policies (ie. blanket bans) which prevent assessment of each application on its individual merits. In the majority of cases, exceptional circumstances will be deemed to be emergency situation. The head teacher in making a decision whether to grant leave during term time should consider all the circumstances surrounding the request.</p> <p>Where the child&rsquo;s attendance is below 95% the school should only authorise term time absences in exceptional circumstances. If a child has been genuinely ill or had authorised absences other than for leave in term time however, these factor should be taken into account when considering an application.</p> <p>Parent/carers should be advised about the school&rsquo;s policy in relation to leave during term-time The school should also implement procedures where parents/carers must apply for permission for a term-time absence in advance, wherever possible, as it is not good practice to grant permission retrospectively. All requests should be made within an appropriate timeline and all decisions recorded. Schools can make make use of the standard leave request form (Appendix A). Schools should inform parents/carers of the process for applying for exceptional leave in term-time through the usual communication channels.</p> <p>The following guidelines are suggested for considering applications for leave during term time:</p> <ul> <li>any parent requiring an absence for their child, for an exceptional reason other than for the purpose of a holiday, should make their application in writing at least two weeks prior to the time they wish to have leave</li> <li>the school should invite parents in to discuss the reasons for the application, especially when the reasons are unclear</li> <li>the school should reply to all applications in writing stating whether or not the absence has been agreed by the school within 5 days of receiving the application</li> <li>the reason for not authorising a request must be clearly stated and evidence given If leave is granted, the length of authorised absence must be clearly stated and dates included so that the parent is informed of what date the pupil should be back in school. The school must indicate the consequences should these times not be adhered to, including the possibility that the parent may receive a PN</li> <li>changes to this process should only be made in exceptional circumstances (i.e. emergencies)</li> </ul> <p>Should a child fail to return to school following a period of leave, the school may, with the agreement of the LA, and following all statutory checks, delete from roll a pupil who meets the following conditions:</p> <p>i. The child must have been granted leave of absence for an exceptional circumstance and</p> <p>ii. Failed to attend for a period of ten days immediately following the date of which he/she was due to return and</p> <p>iii. The school does not have reasonable grounds to believe that he/she is unable to attend school by reason of sickness or other unavoidable cause.</p> <p>iv. The school and LA must have failed, after reasonable enquiry, to ascertain their whereabouts.</p> <p>(from Regulation 8(f) Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 as amended by the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2013).</p> <p>If a pupil does not meet all of the above conditions he/she may not be legally removed from the school roll.

Where a family has taken leave without permission and the school is satisfied that the parent knew the procedures, providing the leave is equal to or more than 9 sessions (4 &frac12; days).</p> <p>2. Where leave of absence has been agreed and the pupil arrives back equal to or more than 9 sessions (4 &frac12; days) after the agreed time without explanation.</p> <p>3. Where no application for leave has been made, providing the period of absences equal to or more than 9 sessions (4 &frac12; days).</p> <p>A PN will only be considered for unauthorised absence where the LA is able and willing to prosecute and satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to show that an offence under Section 444 has been committed and no PN has been issued in relation to the child within the previous twelve months. A parent may receive a separate PN for each child taken out of school.</p> <p>The normal response to a first offence would be to issue the family with a PN warning rather than a penalty. However PNs may be issued for the first offence in more serious offences, for instance when the family regularly take holidays during term time and their period of absence is a continuation of a trend. In cases where a child has been absent for less than 9 sessions (4 &frac12; days), the ACE team recommend issuing the family with a warning letter as an alternative to making a referral for a PN.</p> <p>Full information must be provided by schools before the ACE team can consider issuing a PN. A <strong>fully completed</strong> referral form should be forwarded to ACE with all the required evidence attached. (Appendix B). Once this information has been received then the request will be considered by the ACE Team. All referrals will normally be actioned within 10 working days of receipt and a response will be provided to the referring school. Please see appendix C for a flow-chart of action following referral.</p> <p>Once a PN has been issued, parents often contact the ACE team with a variety of reasons why it should not have been issued. Providing in-depth referral information would assist our service with managing these issues.</p> <p>A parent will not normally receive more than one PN resulting from the unauthorised absence of an individual child in any twelve month period. If unauthorised absence persists after the issue of the first PN, it would normally be appropriate to prosecute or address the attendance using an alternative intervention.</p> <p>Once a PN has been issued, it may only be withdrawn by the ACE team on behalf of the Local authority in the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li>the Notice has been issued to the wrong person</li> <li>the Notice should not have been issued (for example where evidence has been provided after the notice being issued, which covers the period of absence under the conditions of medical absence or unavoidable cause)</li> <li>where the Notice contains material errors (eg: wrong address)</li> <li>in the circumstances of exclusion, reasonable justification has been made out by the parent</li> </ul> <p>There is no specific sanction for the non-payment of a PN, and no specific means of enforcement. However, where the penalty has not been paid at the expiry of the period, the LA has to consider whether to prosecute the parents for the original offence of "failure of their child to attend regularly at the school where the child is a registered pupil". In the vast majority of cases proceedings would be initiated, however in consultation with borough Legal Services a number of factors would be considered when taking the decision to prosecute. The most common reason for not continuing with proceedings is incorrect/inconsistent information being provided on the referral form. For this reason it is important to ensure that information provided to the ACE team is correct and up to date.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|16591,|">Absence from School</a></div> <div class="pagName-nextName"><a href="ILINK|16593,|">Persistent Absenteeism</a></div>]]></paginationbox></content></page_data>$,$Making a Penalty Notice referral$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Education and learning$,,,,$Making a PN referral$,en,schools/attendancechildemployment/penaltynoticehandbook/makingapnreferral.aspx,$Making a Penalty Notice referral - leave in term time$,$Making a Penalty Notice referral$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$child, children, school, attendance$,,,rf-pub-child,5035

You, as parent, are legally responsible under Section 444(1) of the Education Act 1996, for ensuring that your child attends school regularly. As such you are now being referred for a Penalty Notice under Sec. 444 of the Education Act (1996) for failing to ensure the regular attendance of your child(ren).</p> <p>The Penalty Notice is being requested in line with the Code of Conduct administered by the Local Authority. If accepted, a warning letter will be sent, whereby a 15-day monitoring period would be set in order to give you an opportunity to improve your child&rsquo;s attendance and avoid a subsequent fine. Should your child have 5 or more sessions of unauthorised absence during the 15-day monitoring period, a Penalty Notice will be issued. Once issued, a PN incurs a fine of &pound;60.00 rising to &pound;120.00 per child if not paid within 21 days.</p> <p>Please take steps to make sure your child gets to school on time every day, and to obtain a Medical Certificate if he/she is too ill to attend. Any other reason for absence should be discussed with the school and it is the School&rsquo;s decision whether to authorise any absence that is not covered by medical evidence.</p> <p>We thank you for your support in ensuring that your child is not absent from school during term time.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>xxx Head teacher&nbsp;</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|16597,|">Penalty Notice Flowchart</a></div> <br /> <br /> <p><a href="ILINK|16804,|">back to the ACE Reference Manual</a></p>]]></paginationbox></content></page_data>$,$ACE letter proformas$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Education and learning$,,,,$Letter proformas$,en,schools/attendancechildemployment/penaltynoticehandbook/letterproformas.aspx,$Letter proformas$,$ACE letter proformas$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$ACE, letter$,,,rf-pub-child,5041

The Education (Pupil Registration) Regulations 2006 provide statutory regulations for schools relating to maintenance and upkeep of admissions and attendance registers.</p> <p>2. The Department for Education (DfE) advises that schools are legally required to record in the attendance register once at the beginning of the morning session and once during the afternoon whether the pupil is present, absent, engaged in an approved supervised educational activity off-site, or unable to attend due to exceptional circumstances as defined in regulation 6(5). If a child of compulsory school-age pupil is absent, the register should indicate whether the absence is authorised or unauthorised. It must also record the nature of any approved, supervised educational activities.</p> <p>3. The law specifies that the school must allow the Local Authority access to inspect school registers and ACE is the designated service that carries out this duty. Outlined below is guidance for register-keeping that additionally provides details of the aspects that will be covered in an inspection.</p> <h3>Guidance for register- keeping and inspections</h3> <p>1. Daily registers, using OMR forms or equivalent, and Official Registers, should be available for inspection. It is good practice to print-off Official Registers, on a monthly basis, and ensure that they are clearly labelled and maintained in a good condition; however, alternatively they can be stored electronically. It is important to note that Official Registers can be subject to inspection by Ofsted and also be used as evidence, if required, in legal proceedings.</p> <p>2. Names, dates of birth and addresses of children should be clearly recorded and available at the time of inspection. The information can be viewed/printed on Registration Certificates. Paper records should also be held in case of emergency evacuations.</p> <p>3. The totals of unauthorised and authorised absence for each half term should be kept in the Official Register. This information can be used for any required absence returns as well as providing data required for analysis.</p> <p>4. It is a legal requirement, as well as having a health and safety component, that daily registers should be completed up to and including the day of inspection. Morning and afternoon sessions should be recorded each day. It is wholly unacceptable for registers to be completed in advance.</p> <p>5. Authorised and unauthorised absence and lateness codes should be correctly used and supported where necessary with additional commentary. Additional commentary can be entered into School Information Management System (SIMS) to accompany the absence code. Correspondence can be stored electronically either in SIMS or on the School Network in a clearly identifiable location. Paper correspondence can be held on Pupil&rsquo;s manual file. In terms 2 of lateness, comments and/or minutes late can be entered in SIMS to accompany the Late Code.</p> <p>6. Evidence of action taken by school staff regarding unauthorised absence needs to be recorded. As noted above, comments can be entered in SIMS to accompany the absence code and correspondence can be stored electronically either in SIMS or on the School Network in a clearly identifiable location. Paper correspondence can be held on an individual pupil&rsquo;s manual file.</p> <p>7. Systems need to be in place for a school to identify pupils falling into DfE category of &lsquo;persistent absence&rsquo;. SIMS Attendance reports should be run each week once all attendance marks have been recorded, using all correct absence codes.</p> <p>8. All schools have a responsibility to ensure that they have robust IT back-ups in place. This covers both SIMS and any documents on the network. SMS offer advice on back-up solutions. Any further advice on SIMS should be directed to School Management Support Team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h3>Removal of Children from the School Roll</h3> <p>The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006s8 (2f) specify the circumstances when a pupil can be legally be removed from the admissions/attendance register. Unlawful deletions from admissions/attendance register can lead to children missing education as well as vital safeguarding implications. The Z code should be used when a child&rsquo;s name has been removed from the school roll. Inspections by the Local Authority and Ofsted will pay particular attention to children who have been removed from a school roll.</p> <p>GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE FOR ANALYSING ATTENDANCE DATA AND STARTING APPROPRIATE ACTION</p> <p>1. It is the responsibility of school staff to have systems in place for regularly analysing school attendance data and starting appropriate action to ensure that both individual and overall school attendance is maintained to a satisfactory level. SIMS would be used to undertake this work.</p> <p>2. The school attendance lead should explore ways which the SIMS can be used to better understand a school&rsquo;s attendance profile, to ensure appropriate, timely action is taken. The information can be used to tackle both individual school attendance, group and school overall attendance. The reports can be produced to look at attendance data on individual pupils as well as analysing particular year groups, classes or forms. SIMS can also provide a group analysis based upon categories of attendance codes being used.</p> <p>3. Ideally attendance data needs to be analysed weekly to swiftly identify trends and patterns of attendance. A recommendation for good practice would be for this to be done weekly to provide an ongoing analysis of attendance to ensure prompt appropriate action is taken about the attendance of individuals, and also to target particular groups of children e.g. classes, year groups etc.</p> <p>4. School strategies should be employed to tackle an individual pupil&rsquo;s attendance percentage: telephone contact, letters home, meetings, contracts and setting individual attendance targets. SUPPORTING SCHOOL 3 ATTENDANCE: UNAUTHORISED ABSENCE &ndash; PLAN OF ACTION provides suggested timescale for appropriate action.</p> <p>5. Consideration of a request for support from Localities/Early Help services in relation to school attendance should be made in response to attendance percentage below 90% over a 6-week period that has not been improved by school strategies.</p> <p>6. There will be cases where the timing of a request for support for school attendance should be considered, for instance, if an attendance percentage below 90% has started to improve towards the end of a 6-week period (e.g. child has returned to school following a 2-week or 3-week unauthorised holiday in term-time). Logically the period for monitoring should be further extended to take this into consideration, before requesting support for attendance. School staff may also want to consider an earlier referral if the child has more complex needs.</p> <p>7. Whether or not an absence is authorised is the decision of school staff, not parents/carers. School staff should be mindful of not authorising regular or prolonged periods of authorised absence unless it is medically substantiated, and parent/carers should be informed of the decision not to authorise future absences.</p> <p>8. In terms of regular or prolonged medically-substantiated absence, consideration needs to be given to the child&rsquo;s suitability for mainstream educational provision on health grounds.

Please ensure where possible you have confirmation of the new educational provision the pupil is transferring to before removing a child from your roll. You have a duty to inform your local authority and the local authority where the child lives.</p> <p>Circumstances in which a child can be removed from a school/academy roll:</p> <p>1. Child is transferred to roll at another place of education and name and address of same has been established. Action: information about child should be passed to staff in the new school and common transfer file (CTF) via s2s website.</p> <p>2. Child has been absent for 20 continuous school days or more without explanation or authorisation; school/academy has made all reasonable enquiries as to child&rsquo;s whereabouts and local authority where child resides confirms child cannot be found. Action: child must remain on roll until reasonable enquiries completed, even if this absence exceeds 20 days.</p> <p>3. Child has failed to return from previously authorised leave within 10 school days of the agreed return date. The total absence period, including the authorised leave period, must be equal to or more than 20 school days. Action: School/academy staff must make sure child does not have good reason for failing to return on agreed date. The school/academy and local authority must make reasonable enquiries to locate child. Child must remain on roll until the enquiries have been concluded</p> <p>4. Child has ceased to attend school and no longer ordinarily resides at a place which is reasonable distance from the school at which he/she is registered. Action: School/academy must ensure that the new address is obtained from the parent/carer. Appropriate members of staff in the local authority that the child has moved are notified. Members of staff at the school the child has left have received confirmation of receipt of the notification, in order that they can ensure that the child is in receipt of education.</p> <p>5. Parents/carers have withdrawn child from school/academy and have given written notice that child will be educated otherwise than at school*. (It is unlawful for school/academies to encourage parents/carers to educate children at home as a way of avoiding an issue staff in school should be tackling.) Action: If parents/carers indicate desire to educate children at home, matter should be referred to the Tri-borough ACE team. *This does not apply if a child is attending your school in compliance with a School Attendance Order.</p> <p>6. Child is in custody for period exceeding four months and there is no reason to think that he/she will return to school at the end of that period. Action: Child detained for purely medical reasons should not be treated as child in custody.</p> <p>7. Child has been permanently excluded. Action: Removal from roll cannot take place until outcome of any appeal known.</p> <p>8. Child is medically unfit and will remain so until after his or her official leaving date. Action: School/academy staff must gather substantial medical evidence and work with other agencies to find other suitable education enabling dual registration.</p> <p>9. Child has died.</p> <p>*There is different consideration for Special (SEN) schools.</p> <p>If you need further clarification about removing a child from roll, please contact Tri-borough Attendance, Child Employment/Licensing &amp; Elective Home Education/Children Missing Education (ACE) team.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|16607,|">Register Inspection Form</a></div> <div class="pagName-nextName"><a href="ILINK|16609,|">Children Missing Education</a></div>]]></paginationbox><HEAD xmlns=""><![CDATA[]]></HEAD></content></page_data>$,$Removal from School Roll$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Education and learning$,,,,$Removal from School Roll$,en,schools/attendancechildemployment/acesupportingattendance/removalfromschoolroll.aspx,$Removal from School Roll$,$Removal from School Roll$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$school, attendance$,,,rf-pub-child,5051

If there is no more information and school staff have no specific and substantiated concerns, the pupil&rsquo;s name can be removed from the roll.</p> <p>Only when the Local Authority has specific concerns should contact be made with other Local Authorities.

Introduction</h3> <p>a. From July 2013 all Education Welfare Officers across the Tri Borough have been transferred to Locality/Early Help services, multidisciplinary teams offering early intervention and preventive support to families and children.</p> <p>b. If a parent or carer, member of school staff or other professional is concerned about a child&rsquo;s school attendance, he or she should complete the relevant referral form for the respective boroughs Locality/Early Help services, (3b).</p> <p>c. The ACE team will retain responsibility for all whole-school statutory services (e.g. register inspections, Penalty Notices) and will also be available to answer school queries on policy and procedure in relation to school attendance.</p> <p>d. There are, however, some specific responsibilities for individual children that ACE will retain. This document is a guide to how ACE and Locality/Early Help staff will work together to support families and children in this borough.</p> <h3>2. Children missing education (CME) or having elective home education (EHE)</h3> <p>a. CME are children who have no educational provision. They are not children who have provision but&nbsp;have poor attendance or those who are approved as electively home educated.</p> <p>b. Because all LAs have a statutory responsibility to all CME, ACE will be responsible for maintaining a Tri Borough register of all children notified to ACE as out of school (this register includes EHE children as well as CME children).</p> <p>c. Any professional who identifies a child he or she believes to be either CME or EHE is asked to inform ACE at once in writing, providing the child&rsquo;s name, address,&nbsp;date of birth, &nbsp;and previous educational provision if known.</p> <p>d. ACE will then work with colleagues as appropriate to ensure CME are placed and EHE families are properly supported using agreed procedures.</p> <p>e. If any professional has wider concerns about a family whose child is CME or EHE, they will either complete the appropriate Locality/Early Help referral form (4c) or, if there are child protection concerns, an Interagency Referral Form (5d).</p> <h3>3. Children with continuing poor attendance at school &ndash; legal action</h3> <p>a. Locality/Early Help services can offer a range of support to families (e.g. parenting support or family support) which will in some cases include support with school attendance.</p> <p>b. As this support is intended to be preventative &lsquo;early intervention&rsquo;, if families are unwilling or unable to make good use of this support and children continue not to attend school satisfactorily, these cases will be referred to ACE, who will be responsible for starting legal action, either in Magistrates Court (prosecutions) or Family Proceedings Court (Education Supervision Orders).</p> <p>c. ACE will need to rely on evidence of interventions and work carried out by Locality/Early Help staff, as magistrates expect local authorities to have been proactive in supporting and working with families to solve attendance problems before starting legal action.</p> <p>d. ACE is available to liaise with Locality/Early Help staff on any case where attendance problems are proving intractable. Telephone or e-mail advice may be enough, but ACE input into meetings between Locality/Early Help staff, school staff, other professionals and families will also be available.</p> <p>e. If court action leads to magistrates imposing a Parenting Order or an Education Supervision Order, ACE will liaise with Locality/Early Help staff on the most effective way to discharge the local authority&rsquo;s responsibilities for the order.</p> <h3>4. Children in employment or entertainment</h3> <p>a. ACE will continue to have oversight of the LA&rsquo;s legal requirements in both of these areas of work.</p> <p>b. Any professional working with a child should notify ACE if he or she believes the child to be working or taking part in an activity warranting an entertainment licence.</p> <h3>5. Conclusion</h3> <p>a. These guidelines have been issued to facilitate consistent practice and good communication between the Locality/Early Help services and ACE.</p> <p>b. Individual cases may require a response from services not covered by these guidelines.</p> <p>c. ACE will be flexible in support offered to schools and Locality/Early Help staff, and can be contacted on 020 8753 2877 with any queries.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|16611,|">Record of Untraceable Child</a></div> <br /> <br /> <p><a href="ILINK|16804,|">back to the ACE Reference Manual</a></p>]]></paginationbox><HEAD xmlns=""><![CDATA[]]></HEAD></content></page_data>$,$Supporting school attendance - Working in partnership$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Education and learning$,,,,$Working in Partnership$,en,schools/attendancechildemployment/acesupportingattendance/workinginpartnership.aspx,$Working in Partnership$,$Supporting school attendance - Working in partnership$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$partnership, ACE, attendance, school$,,,rf-pub-child,5055

Do not leave it until the last minute. Do not permanently leave your home until you are legally obliged to do so (usually by court order) as this may damage any application for help that you make to this or any other council.</p> <p>The following information and links will familiarise you with the process of making an application.</p> <p><strong>1. Do I qualify</strong></p> <p>The first thing you need to establish is whether you are eligable . If we believe you may be eligible, homeless and in priority need, we have a duty to provide <strong>temporary</strong> accommodation while we carry out our enquiries. Read the following criteria:</p> <p>Eligability&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>are you a British/Irish citizen, a European national working in the UK or with a permanent right to reside?</li> <li>have you been granted leave to remain in the UK with recourse to public funds?</li> </ul> <p>Homelessness</p> <ul> <li>have you received a Notice or a Court Order requiring you to leave your home?</li> <li>are friends or family that you have been staying with asking you to leave?</li> <li>do you have to leave your home as a result of violence?</li> </ul> <p>Priority need</p> <ul> <li>do you have children who live with you or are you pregnant?</li> <li>are you vulnerable as a result of your health, age or for other reasons?</li> </ul> <p>Intentionally homeless</p> <ul> <li>did you cause the loss of your accommodation because of rent arrears or antisocial behaviour?</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2.

If you qualify we will arrange a meeting</strong> to make an application</p> <p>You will need to come to the Town Hall &nbsp;and <strong>bring correct documentation</strong></p> <h3><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h3> <h3>How long will it take for me to be seen by a duty housing adviser?</h3> <p>We cannot say how long it will take to be seen, because this depends on how many people have come to us on that particular day. If you need to be urgently housed on the day, then it is probably best for you to come to the Town Hall as early as possible.</p> <h3>Will I automatically be given somewhere to live?</h3> <p>This depends on your individual circumstances. If we believe you are eligible, homeless and in priority need, you will be offered temporary accommodation. We will then look at your application in more detail and decide if you should be given suitable accommodation.</p> <h3>How long does it take for a decision to be made on my homeless application?</h3> <p>This depends on your circumstances and the enquiries we need to make, so it varies from person to person. Some of the important factors are:</p> <ul> <li>where you were living before</li> <li>your reasons for being homeless</li> <li>your social and medical circumstances.</li> </ul> <p>These are just some of the things we need to look at when taking an application.</p> <h3>Making a homeless application</h3> <p>If you make a homeless application, we will consider your individual circumstances to work out what, if any, housing duty is owed to you. The Council is obliged to assess your application under Part VII of the Housing Act 1996, as amended by Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation)(England) Order 2002.</p> <p>We use national law and guidance to assess homelessness applications, including the <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" title="Homlessness Code of Guidance" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/homelessness-code-of-guidance-for-councils-july-2006" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}"> Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities</a> (opens a PDF document from <a href="http://www.gov.uk/">www.gov.uk</a> in a new window).</p> <p>There are tests within the legislation that are applied to all homeless applications.

The four threshold tests you must meet to access social housing are:</p> <ul> <li>eligible for assistance;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>homeless or threatened with homelessness within 28 days;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND</li> <li>in priority need;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND</li> <li>NOT intentionally homeless</li> </ul> <p>We will need to see certain documents to fully assess your application, for example we need to know what your nationality is and if applicable, what your status is in the UK.&nbsp; Try to bring as many of these with you as you can:</p> <ul> <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">Identification for all family members: <ul> <li>full birth certificates</li> <li>passport</li> <li>European identity cards</li> <li>Home Office immigration papers</li> </ul> </li> <li>proof of pregnancy (if applicable)</li> <li>proof of residency for the last five years</li> <li>tenancy agreement, notice to quit, possession summons/order, bailiff's warrant</li> <li>letter from parents, relative or friend saying they can no longer accommodate you</li> <li>rent book, receipts or any other proof of rent</li> <li>marriage certificate, divorce papers (if applicable)</li> <li>injunction orders, custody orders (if applicable)</li> <li>contract of employment, letter terminating employment (if applicable)</li> <li>wage slips, benefit books, bank statements, savings accounts</li> </ul> <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">Below are examples of what can be considered in relation to each of the tests set out in the legislation.

If you are outside this time, <strong>you do not have a right to a&nbsp;review</strong>. We may consider it however, if you show that exceptional&nbsp;circumstances caused you to be late.</p> <h2>Can I get help with my&nbsp;request for a review?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">You may find that an independent legal or specialist housing adviser can help you with this process. Let us know that you are&nbsp;asking for a review as soon as you can, and then seek this help&nbsp;to save time. You may also wish to provide new information, in&nbsp;which case you may need the help of professionals, such as&nbsp;social workers or doctors, who know about your situation.</p> <h2>Who will deal with my review?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">Your review will be dealt with by one of the Council&rsquo;s review officers. This person will be independent of the original decision and experienced in housing law so that they can reach a new decision on your case.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">You can contact the review officer either by email to <a title="Housing review email" href="mailto:housingreviews@rbkc.gov.uk">housingreviews@rbkc.gov.uk</a> or alternatively in writing:</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Review Officer<br /> Housing Needs Department<br /> Second Floor<br /> The Town Hall<br /> Hornton Street<br /> London W8 7NX</p> <h2>What happens next?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">You will receive a letter within one week which acknowledges your request for a review. It will also explain the process. If you do not have an address, this letter (and any others concerning your review) will be kept in the Customer Services Centre at the Town Hall for you to collect. Your case will be examined objectively and independently to make sure that the original decision was reached in a lawful way and was correct based on the information available.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">A new &lsquo;review decision&rsquo; will be reached. This must take account of your circumstances now and since the original decision was made. We may need to make enquiries and seek further information so this can take time. If you have a solicitor or specialist adviser acting for you, we will contact them rather than contacting you directly.</p> <h2>How long will it take?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">The law allows for up to eight weeks to complete most reviews (and longer for reviews of some referral decisions). However, in some cases the process can take longer and it may be necessary for you, your representative or the review officer to ask for an extension to complete the review.</p> <h2>Will I continue to be accommodated?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">The Council does not have a duty to accommodate you while the review is being carried out and we do not normally provide accommodation, so you will need to make alternative arrangements. We may have to provide accommodation in exceptional circumstances - where we believe the original decision could be unlawful and may be overturned, or where new information puts it in doubt and you would face exceptional hardship without accommodation (more so than other people who are homeless).</p> <h2>What is the law around the review process?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">Section 202 of Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 (amended in 2002) instructs councils how reviews are to be carried out. The procedures for reviews are covered in Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 71. You can find copies of these in your local library, and housing advisers and solicitors will also keep copies. You can find the law on&nbsp;the <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1996/1996052.htm" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}"> Legislation.gov.uk&nbsp;website</a>, along with the <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1999/19990071.htm#n3" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}"> Statutory Instrument</a>.</p> <h2>What if I think the review decision is still wrong?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">If you still believe the Council has made an unlawful decision, the law allows you to seek a County Court Appeal (Section 204 of the 1996 Act). You must apply to the County Court within 21 days of the notification of the review decision and on a point of law. It is recommended that you obtain legal advice if you do seek such an appeal.</p>]]></content><related xmlns=""><![CDATA[<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" title="Homelessness leaflet" href="PDF/Homelessness%20asking%20for%20a%20review%20of%20a%20decision%20housing%20factsheet%2021.pdf" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}"> <img width="82" alt="Homelessness2" title="Homelessness2" src="images/homelessness%20leaflet2_v_o.jpg" style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px" height="109" /></a></p> <p><sup><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" href="PDF/Homelessness%20asking%20for%20a%20review%20of%20a%20decision%20housing%20factsheet%2021.pdf" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}"> Homelessness</a>: asking for a review of a decision&nbsp;</strong></sup><sup>[PDF] (file size 622Kb)</sup></p>]]></related><seealso xmlns=""><![CDATA[]]></seealso><contactbutton xmlns=""><![CDATA[]]></contactbutton><contentsbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<h2>Homelessness appeal and review procedure</h2> <p>The Council has a duty to provide advice and help to anyone who is homeless.

Your case will be examined objectively and independently to make sure that the original decision was reached in a lawful way and was correct based on the information available.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">A new &lsquo;review decision&rsquo; will be reached. This must take account of your circumstances now and since the original decision was made. We may need to make enquiries and seek further information so this can take time. If you have a solicitor or specialist adviser acting for you, we will contact them rather than contacting you directly.</p> <h2>How long will it take?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">The law allows for up to eight weeks to complete most reviews (and longer for reviews of some referral decisions). However, in some cases the process can take longer and it may be necessary for you, your representative or the review officer to ask for an extension to complete the review.</p> <h2>Will I continue to be accommodated?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">The Council does not have a duty to accommodate you while the review is being carried out and we do not normally provide accommodation, so you will need to make alternative arrangements. We may have to provide accommodation in exceptional circumstances - where we believe the original decision could be unlawful and may be overturned, or where new information puts it in doubt and you would face exceptional hardship without accommodation (more so than other people who are homeless).</p> <h2>What is the law around the review process?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">Section 202 of Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 (amended in 2002) instructs councils how reviews are to be carried out. The procedures for reviews are covered in Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 71. You can find copies of these in your local library, and housing advisers and solicitors will also keep copies. You can find the law on&nbsp;the <a title="link to government legislation website" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1996/1996052.htm">Legislation.gov.uk&nbsp;website</a>, along with the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><a title="link to Statutory Instrument " href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1999/19990071.htm#n3">Statutory Instrument</a>.</p> <h2>What if I think the review decision is still wrong?</h2> <p class="MsoNormal">If you still believe the Council has made an unlawful decision, the law allows you to seek a County Court Appeal (Section 204 of the 1996 Act). You must apply to the County Court within 21 days of the notification of the review decision and on a point of law. It is recommended that you obtain legal advice if you do seek such an appeal.</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a title="When a decision is made" href="ILINK|17126,|">When a decision is made</a></div>]]></paginationbox></content></page_data>$,$Homelessness appeal and review procedure When a decision is made on your application, your caseworker will write and tell you what our decision is$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Housing,,,,$Appeals and reviews$,en,housingbeta/housingadvicesupport/homelessness/appealsandreviews.aspx,$Appeals and reviews$,$Homelessness appeal and review procedure When a decision is made on your application, your caseworker will write and tell you what our decision is$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$review, review officer, homelessness decision, homelessness appeal$,,,rf-pub-child,5107

Provision of a suitable education</h2> <h3>Do children educated otherwise have to follow the National Curriculum?</h3> <p>Parents are not legally required to do this. However some find it useful to know what the National Curriculum is and what children are taught in school.</p> <p>The current National Curriculum subjects are listed below:</p> <p>English, mathematics, science, ICT (information &amp; communication technology), history, geography, art, DT (design &amp; technology), physical education, modern foreign languages (from age 11), RE (religious education &ndash; unless parents exercise their right to withdraw their children).</p> <h3>What does &lsquo;providing full-time education&rsquo; mean?</h3> <p>Currently schools work for 25 or 27.5 hours a week according to the ages of their pupils. Home educating parents are under no obligation to follow these hours and each family will vary in how they organise their days to ensure that enough time is spent on teaching and learning each week.</p> <h3>How should teaching and children&rsquo;s learning be organised?</h3> <p>No one approach can be recommended. Parents should consider what the best teaching style is for themselves and for their children. Whatever style is adopted, it should allow children to become actively involved and provide opportunities for learning through practical activities and may well change over time.</p> <h3>What resources are available for use by parents and children?&nbsp;</h3> <ul> <li>A range of books for reading for pleasure and information</li> <li>Commercially produced workbooks related to the National Curriculum</li> <li>Educational broadcasts (TV, radio) are useful, but to avoid the passive watching syndrome, the programmes should be well prepared and followed up</li> <li>Visits to interesting places (museums, theatres, exhibitions, historic sites, lectures, nature walks, etc)</li> <li>Computer software with programmes for consolidating and extending learning in all subjects</li> </ul> <br /> <h3>Who should provide the education?</h3> <p>Parents are responsible for ensuring that an efficient education is given. This requirement does not mean that they have to do all the teaching. Some of it can be done by suitable friends, with other home educating families or by private tutors.</p> <h3>How do I ensure my child receives an effective social education?</h3> <p>The development of social skills is an essential part of a balanced and efficient education. Learning activities out and about in the community gives children opportunities to experience social contacts, for example, clubs (gymnastics, drama, cubs, Sunday school, young musicians, youth choir, swimming and many more).</p> <h3>Can my child attend school part-time?</h3> <p>No. This is not considered viable as it blocks a place for a full-time pupil and has been found not to be in the best interests of the individual child. If children are receiving home education, they are not on a school&rsquo;s register. In very exceptional circumstances governors of a school might consider making special arrangements for a short time only but the law is very clear that pupils must attend school or be educated otherwise.</p> <h3>Advice on examinations</h3> <p>Home educated children do not have to sit any Standard Assessment Tests (SATs) or GCSEs. It is possible however for home educated children to sit GCSEs if desired, although there is currently no funding from central government or the Local Authority.</p> <p>There are a number of different examination boards that offer GCSE qualifications and each offer a variety of syllabuses.

Alternatives to Exclusion (including 'managed moves')</h2> <p>Headteachers should, as far as possible, avoid excluding permanently any pupil with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHC), a statement of SEN or a looked after child. Statutory guidance on strategies to be employed are covered in the DfE exclusions guidance (page 9, para. 21-23).</p> <p>The guidance promotes the use of early intervention strategies by schools to address underlying causes of disruptive behaviour and avoid exclusions. Maintained schools have the power to direct a pupil off-site for education to improve his or her behaviour. Academies can place a pupil either full-time or part-time in another educational setting with parental agreement.</p> <p>A pupil can also transfer to another school as part of a &lsquo;managed move&rsquo; where this occurs with the consent of the parties involved, including the parents. However, it must be stressed that the threat of exclusion must never be used to influence parents to remove their child from the school.</p> <p>All such options can be discussed with the Tri-Borough Alternative Provision Service (TBAP).The Tri-Borough Alternative Provision Service (TBAP) works with learners from across the three boroughs that are experiencing difficulty with mainstream school and can provide schools with a menu of options.</p> <p>TBAP Commissioning and School Support (CSS) is the single point of contact for secondary schools in the three boroughs to discuss all aspects of school based interventions or managed moves, where schools are actively considering possible alternatives to exclusion.

These are known as the &lsquo;threshold tests&rsquo;. The four threshold tests you must meet to access social housing are:</p> <ul> <li>eligible for assistance; AND</li> <li>homeless or threatened with homelessness within 28 days; AND</li> <li>in priority need; AND</li> <li>NOT intentionally homeless</li> </ul> <p>We will need to see certain documents to fully assess your application, for example we need to know what your nationality is and if applicable, what your status is in the UK. Try to bring as many of these with you as you can:</p> <ul> <li>Identification for all family members: <ul> <li>full birth certificates</li> <li>passport</li> <li>European identity cards</li> <li>Home Office immigration papers</li> </ul> </li> <li>proof of pregnancy (if applicable)</li> <li>proof of residency for the last five years</li> <li>tenancy agreement, notice to quit, possession summons/order, bailiff's warrant</li> <li>letter from parents, relative or friend saying they can no longer accommodate you</li> <li>rent book, receipts or any other proof of rent</li> <li>marriage certificate, divorce papers (if applicable)</li> <li>injunction orders, custody orders (if applicable)</li> <li>contract of employment, letter terminating employment (if applicable)</li> <li>wage slips, benefit books, bank statements, savings accounts</li> </ul> <div>Below are examples of what can be considered in relation to each of the tests set out in the legislation.

We will put your details on the Housing Register. This is a list of all people looking for social housing (which is housing run by the Council or housing associations). Once you are on the register, you can bid for properties that become available. The properties you can bid for will depend on the priority points we award you. For more information, visit our <a title="Visit our Social Housing page" href="ILINK|16787,|">social housing page</a>.</p> <p>Following a change in law (Localism Act 2011), councils are now able to offer suitable private rented accommodation to homeless households, instead of social housing. Under the new law, we are only required to make ONE offer of private rented accommodation to end our housing duty towards you. The property offered could be located anywhere in the UK, as long as we consider it to be suitable for your household&rsquo;s needs.</p> <p>To give you an alternative and greater choice about where you are rehoused, the Council has developed the <a title="Private Rented Access Scheme" href="ILINK|16767,|">Private Rented Access Scheme (PRAS</a>).&nbsp;You will still move to private rented housing, but you find the accommodation rather than waiting for us to make an offer.</p> <p>If we decide that we <strong>do not</strong> have a duty to continue housing you, we will normally continue to provide accommodation for 28 days from the date of decision.</p> <h2>If I don&rsquo;t meet the criteria to be rehoused, what will happen then?</h2> <p>Unfortunately, we are is unable to rehouse every single person who is homeless.</p> <p>We will send you a letter explaining why we cannot rehouse you. if you disagree with the decision made, <a title="You can request a review" href="ILINK|16693,|"><strong>you can request a review</strong></a>.</p> <p>We will provide you with advice and assistance in order to help you to secure your own accommodation.</p> <h2>If I am accepted for rehousing, how long does it take to be given&nbsp;accommodation?</h2> <p>It is impossible to say how long you will wait for longer-term accommodation. &nbsp;It may take some time as the demand is far greater than the supply.</p> <p><strong><strong>There is a huge demand for social housing in the Royal Borough but last year only&nbsp;436 properties to let</strong>.

This revision reflects the Royal Borough's continued commitment to the professionalisation of our support staff body. It offers more flexibility allowing you to tweak generic documents (e.g. Job Descriptions, Person Specifications etc.) to your context &ndash; and it is on the internet, for greater ease of access.</p> <p>In addition, the revised Royal Borough guidance reflects the National Occupational Standards for Support Staff. These describe what people need to be able to do, as well as what they must know and understand for their work. They are useful statements of competence describing good practice and they underpin Support Staff qualifications.</p> <p>The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea value the huge contribution that Support Staff make to school and pupil outcomes. Such impact does not happen by chance but is the result of a practical strategy underpinned by the belief that the most effective support staff are learners themselves and highly reflective practitioners.&nbsp; To have impact, support staff must understand their role and have opportunities to develop their skills, expertise, knowledge and understanding. The Royal Borough is committed to high quality performance management for all support staff.&nbsp; It is through this professional dialogue that support staff are supported and challenged to be the very best for our children and young people.</p> <p>In 2003, there was a major national focus on developing support staff roles in schools to help to raise standards and to tackle workload issues. Across the country, support staff increased &ndash; both the number of support staff and also the range of roles. In 2009, 49 per cent of the school workforce in Kensington and Chelsea comprised support staff. The Royal Borough continues to support the professional development of this significant part of the school workforce.</p> <p>This section of our website includes four professional frameworks for different support staff groups:</p> <ul> <li><a href="ILINK|17860,|">class based support staff</a></li> <li><a href="ILINK|17861,|">learning mentors</a></li> <li><a href="ILINK|17862,|">administration and business support staff</a></li> <li><a href="ILINK|17863,|">site&nbsp;staff&nbsp;</a></li> </ul> <p>Each professional framework is comprised of documents, advice and guidance around recruitment, deployment, pay, professional development, national occupational standards and performance management.</p> <p>Each Professional Framework provides generic job descriptions and person specifications for schools to customise to their context.&nbsp; Advice and guidance around deployment and pay will also be included in addition to resources that help schools to make effective use of&nbsp; the relevant national occupational standards to benchmark performance and identify areas for development &ndash; very useful as part of the performance management process.</p> <p>Each framework begins with a &lsquo;summary overview&rsquo; identifying key issues around deployment, pay,open folder of green binder qualifications and national standards for that particular support staff group.</p> <p><span><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>If you have any questions about the Green Binder please email us at&nbsp;</span><a title="Continuing Professional Developing Mailbox address" href="mailto:cpdteam@rbkc.gov.uk">cpdteam@rbkc.gov.uk</a></p> <p><em>We are indebted to the original Royal Borough Headteachers, Unions and HR colleagues for developing the first Green Binder. This revised guidance was produced in collaboration and consultation with a number of school colleagues and support staff unions. Special thanks to Bernadette McHugh (Human Resources) and the following schools and Union Representatives: Servite RC Primary School, Marlborough Primary School, Avondale Park Primary School, Oratory RC Primary School, Chelsea Open Air Nursery School and Children's Centre, Unison, GMB.</em></p> <p><em>Produced by Janis Denselow (Training and Development Manager, Continuing Professional Development Service, RBKC), Maddy Luxon (Advanced Skills Teacher &ndash; AST for Support Staff) and Charmaine Jude (Senior Administrator, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea)</em></p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-nextName"><a title="class based supprt staff" href="ILINK|17860,|">Class based support staff</a></div>]]></paginationbox></content></page_data>$,$Green Binder of Professional Frameworks for Support Staff$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Continuing Professional Development Service for RBKC schools$,,,,$Green Binder$,en,cpdforschools/greenbinder.aspx,$Green Binder of Professional Frameworks for Support Staff$,$Green Binder of Professional Frameworks for Support Staff$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Green, Binder,  Professional, Frameworks,  Support, Staff,$,,,rf-pub-parent,6040

NOS are benchmarks of good practice which have been used here to develop Job Descriptions and to facilitate reflective practice as part of the performance management process. The 'Performance Management Trackers' can be used to&nbsp;focus dialogue between support staff and their line manager on successes and areas for professional development.</p> <p>This Professional Framework has identified&nbsp;four distinctly different roles:</p> <ul> <li>Administrative Assistant/ Receptionist</li> <li>Administrative Officer</li> <li>Senior Administrative Officer</li> <li>Business Operations Manager</li> </ul> <p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;" href="pdf/Professional%20Framework%20for%20Admin%20and%20Finance%20Support%20Staff%20Final%2024.06.11.pdf" onkeypress="if (event.keyCode==13) {window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;}"> The Professional Framework summary table</a> [PDF] (file size 147Kb)</p> <p>This document provides an overview of the&nbsp;four specific roles with their corresponding Job Descriptions and Person Specifications. Advice and guidance around pay, deployment and performance management is also summarised.</p> <hr style="WIDTH: 100%; HEIGHT: 1px" /> <h2>Generic Documents</h2> <p>These generic documents (below)&nbsp;act as starting points to develop Job Descriptions and Person Specifications to suit individual schools and contexts.</p> <p>School Leaders and Governors will find the resources useful in recruitment; Line Managers will find the resources and guidance useful in managing support staff performance; and support staff themselves should use the resources to reflect on their role, their contribution to whole school priorities and their professional development needs. As the documents are all based upon National Occupational Standards, they are useful in reviewing and benchmarking professional practice.</p> <p><strong>Please note - these files are provided in Word format so that they can be edited.&nbsp;

Under the scheme, local businesses that sign up to the programme will be able to hire or purchase original artworks created by students studying in the borough, to enhance their office spaces.</p> <p>The work is presented to professional gallery standards, and businesses are able to choose artworks directly from the Schools Art on Show Exhibition in June. Taking part in the programme offers a unique opportunity for businesses to link Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) with an enhanced working environment and employee wellbeing.</p> <p>Watch this short film to find out how the programme works:</p> <h2><RBKC:EMBEDOBJECT objectcodetext='<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/99642970" width="619" height="280" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>'></RBKC:EMBEDOBJECT></h2> <h2>The benefits</h2> <p>The Schools Art on Show project provides an ideal opportunity for businesses to meet Corporate Social Responsibility targets, by supporting art departments in the borough&rsquo;s schools, giving a sense of purpose to young artists studying in the borough, and supporting development of an innovative project at Leighton House Museum.</p> <p>Students whose work is selected by a business through the programme will receive recognition that can be included in their portfolio or CV, and so contributing to their professional development.</p> <p>Research demonstrates that staff are more productive if they can tailor their surroundings to their needs and preferences. Employees can be invited to view the works during the Exhibition in June and choose pieces for their office spaces, offering a mechanism for staff to personally select artworks for their working environment. Changing the artwork regularly through hiring the work increases the opportunity for staff engagement and ownership of their surroundings; or if a piece is well liked by all, a business is able to purchase available pieces too.</p> <p>Hiring artworks through the programme also offers a practical solution for businesses operating in flexible or short-term contemporary offices designed to be reconfigured as and when, and complements flexible working arrangements.&nbsp;Participating businesses will also benefit from marketing opportunities associated with being part of the programme.</p> <h2>How it works</h2> <p>Each piece on loan or purchased will come with an accompanying caption with information about the Schools Art on Show programme, which can be displayed alongside the piece. This demonstrates clearly to clients and external visitors that the business is participating in the programme.&nbsp;Further marketing opportunities could include mention of participating businesses in publicity produced by the Council, features in case studies used to promote the programme, and on the Council's website.</p> <p>Income generated through artwork hire fees paid by participating businesses is split between covering costs and a contribution to schools and/or students whose artwork is on loan to businesses. Income generated from artwork sales directly from the Exhibition will go to the artist, minus a small commission which will cover the costs of administering the sale. As the Schools Art on Show programme for businesses develops, a proportion of the income could be set aside for developing future sustainability for the Art on Show project or increasing access to arts activities for young people in the borough.</p> <p>Artworks will be available and ready to hang from July 2015.</p> <p>To get involved or for further information contact Jennifer Wood in the Council&rsquo;s Arts Service via email <a href="mailto:Jennifer.Wood@rbkc.gov.uk">Jennifer.Wood@rbkc.gov.uk</a> or on 020 7361 4378.</p>]]></contentsbox><paginationbox xmlns=""><![CDATA[<div class="pagName-previousName"><a href="ILINK|18084,|">Schools Submissions Form</a></div> <div class="pagName-nextName"><a href="ILINK|18086,|">Shortlisted Artworks</a></div>]]></paginationbox></content></page_data>$,$Art on Loan: information for businesses$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Leisure and libraries$,,,,$Art on Loan$,en,leisureandlibraries/culture/artsservices/aboutartonshow/artonloan.aspx,$Art on Loan: information for businesses$,$Art on Loan: information for businesses$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$Art on Loan: information for businesses,Schools Submissions Form, Art on show,artwork, art on loan,$,,,rf-pub-child,6228
