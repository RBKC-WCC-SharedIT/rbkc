Improvements to the Green will include an upgrade of the lawn, new high quality period style iron railings and an overhaul of signs around it. The existing mature cherry tree will be retained. Parking and traffic arrangements will remain virtually as they are, with minor changes to assist pedestrian crossing.     Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Planning and Transportation, Councillor Daniel Moylan said: "We have listened very closely to the local community and have come up with a scheme for Chelsea Green that really adds something to the area, whilst retaining all of its essential character."    The overall aims of the project are to preserve the long-term attractiveness of the Green and to help maintain the competitiveness of the designated local shopping area.","NULL","Contact the Media and Communications Office on 020 7361 2332 for further information about Chelsea Green or to find out more about the Council's Planning and Transporation Vision and Strategy.","NULL","NULL","Chelsea Green","cherry tree","NULL","NULL","NULL","Chelsea Green to blossom under new scheme"

"1154","18/11/2003","NIP HOMELESSNESS IN THE BUD","The aim of the Royal Borough's Housing Information Day was to prevent homelessness before it actually happens.  By targeting 8000 people on the Borough's housing register the event focussed directly on those most likely to suffer the problems associated with homelessness. The event proved particularly popular, with nearly 700 visitors attending.    Rather than waiting for the homeless problem to occur, the Royal Borough has identified five key groups commonly afflicted by homelessness and provided a range of measures to help each.  The information day was an opportunity to showcase these solutions and give these groups a chance to talk through the options open to them. The groups highlighted are those suffering from rent arrears, overcrowding, domestic violence, the elderly and young people.      Tackling these issues at an early stage is important in Kensington and Chelsea as the residential property market is the most expensive in the country.  This can mean that low-income groups have limited options or choice and homelessness can be a very real prospect.    In the case of young people, evidence shows that when leaving home for the first time they can often find themselves homeless and would benefit from some specialist advice and education services.   Parents evicting children contributed 18 per cent to the Borough's homeless figure during 2002/2003.      Initiatives designed to tackle this include the creation of a mediation service that aims to give parents and children an opportunity to talk through any domestic disputes before making a final decision about leaving home.  Other services include a homeless prevention video in conjunction with schools and the creation of a Young Persons Housing Coordinator.     Other initiatives include:    · Independent legal advice   · Developing affordable ownership properties  · Choice Based Lettings Scheme - Home Connections  · HomeStart - Out of London affordable housing    Cabinet Member for Housing, Councillor Timothy Coleridge said: " We aim to tackle the problem of homelessness at its very source.  It is only the combination of prevention, advice and working with partner agencies that will produce real results.  The Information Day proved popular last year and it looks like this years event has proved even more so. "    Last year the `HomeStart' initiative was the theme for a similar event and provided information and advice for residents looking to solve their housing problems by moving out of the capital.  The scheme has proved a popular option and has directly helped to reduce the number of homeless people in the Borough.  The scheme is due to be stepped up in a deliberate move to reach more households.     One major homeless target has been to reduce the number of families with dependent children staying in Bed and Breakfast accommodation.  The Royal Borough has so far reduced this number from over 200 to just 22.    If you would like any advice on any of these matters, please call 0207 937 5464.","Notes for Editors","For further information on any homeless initiatives please call Russell Guthrie in the Press Office on 020 7361 2115","NULL","NULL","Homelessness","housing","Councillor Coleridge","information day","legal advice","The aim of the Royal Borough's Housing Information Day was to prevent homelessness before it actually happens.

The answer to this question is now easier to find as the Royal Borough is leading the way in showing developers what they must do. While the Royal Borough does not have the legacy of land contaminated through previous use that some other London boroughs experience, it does have some sites, large and small that might be classified as contaminated.    The document, called `Contaminated land - A guide to help developers meet planning requirements', sets out the technical information required by the Council and the process that it expects a developer to follow.      The result of a project led by the Royal Borough, the publication brings together the work of 11 London councils.     It shows how anyone wanting to develop a potentially contaminated site in the Royal Borough would be expected to:  carry out a detailed investigation of the site  produce a strategy for cleaning up any contamination identified and   produce a report that shows that the site has been cleaned up to the satisfaction of the Council.    Councillor Walker-Arnott, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, Leisure and Waste Management said: "We are fortunate not to have the large scale contaminated sites found in other boroughs, but it is important that any site which may be contaminated is addressed in a thorough and correct manner. I hope that the publication of this document will prove a useful tool for anyone intending to embark on developing any potentially contaminated sites in the Borough and make our requirements of them clear."

Initial proposals are being developed in adult services, children&#39;s services, environmental services, library services and corporate services.<br /><br />At Prime Minister&#39;s Questions on Wednesday 4 May the PM gave his backing and said that other councils should be doing the same before looking at reductions in frontline services. <br /><br />Councillors at three respective cabinet meetings are set to be updated on how proposals are at an advanced stage to:<br /><br /> combine fostering and adoption services and youth offending services, with the creation of a single Local Safeguarding Children Board. In total this would save nearly £199,000 a year by 2014/15<br /> combine library services, not only saving local residents £1.4m but also giving them the ability to access libraries across the three boroughs for the first time<br /> combine environment management teams in Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, saving £1.5 million with a 48 per cent reduction in senior management (14 posts).<br /><br />Decisions on whether to combine services in these areas are expected to be made in June. That is when councillors will also hear detailed proposals to combine adult services, education services and corporate services. The first appointment across the three councils was made last month when former Westminster City Council Director of Adult Social Care, Marian Harrington was given the task of implementing a combined adult social care commissioning service integrated with heathcare provision.<br /><br />Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea have agreed to share a chief executive from October 2011. The two councils already share senior management posts in legal services, highways and finance.<br /><br />The cabinets&#39; reports reveal that the majority of residents surveyed support the principle of combining services. Of 1,500 residents who took part in a telephone survey in February, 34 per cent said there should be some sharing of services, with 43 per cent saying that the three authorities should share as much as possible. Only 13 per cent of people were opposed to sharing services.<br /><br />Collectively, the three authorities must save £100 million by 2014/15. They have each signed a &#39;Sovereignty Guarantee&#39; to safeguard local autonomy, responsiveness and identity. Each of the councils will retain their own councillors and decision making processes. Services key to local areas, such as housing management, licensing and planning will be not be combined.<br /><br />The Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell said: &#34;Everyone knows the financial straits councils find themselves in. To protect our services we have taken a difficult and challenging road but as this report shows we are making progress and we are making it happen.&#34;<br /><br />Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council Leader Cllr Stephen Greenhalgh said: &#34;This is a common sense way of dealing with the big financial pressures facing councils up and down the country. Combining services is not only more cost effective but would also allow us to improve services in many areas such as allowing Hammersmith residents to access libraries in Westminster and vice versa.&#34;<br /><br />Westminster City C Council Leader Cllr Colin Barrow said: &#34;Every penny saved by our planned collaboration will help protect frontline services while local people across the three boroughs will not see any change in the way these services are delivered. In today&#39;s tough economic climate when council budgets are being scaled back this is a sensible and pragmatic way to deliver a number of services to our local residents.&#34;<br /><br />The Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet meets on Thursday 5 May, with Westminster City Council and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Cabinets meeting respectively on Monday 9 May.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Combine services","Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell","Tri-borough","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea",,"Proposals to combine the first set of services across three West London authorities are set to be discussed by councillors at a series of cabinet meetings in the next week.","Plans to combine council services take leap forward"

These meadows support birds and small mammals and are also home to many invertebrates, including butterflies, grasshoppers and bees.<br /><br />The pigs turn over bulbs which may reduce next year&#39;s flowers. But in the long term the bulbs will benefit from the disturbance and being `chipped&#39; (or split); consequently they are likely to flower more vigorously in following seasons. <br /> <br />The pigs, from Charton Manor Farm in Kent, made the journey up to Holland Park on Friday 13 May and will remain in the park for approximately two months.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","pigs","Holland Park","Environment","Ecology","Wildlife","Six British Saddleback pigs have taken up residency in the prestigious Holland Park, using their well-trained snouts to root up and turn over soil in part of the park.","Holland Park benefits from Pig Society"

This will have a significant effect on traffic travelling along Kensington Road, as well as access to and from De Vere Gardens and Victoria Road. Local diversions will be in place where appropriate. After the gantry has been erected westbound traffic (including high vehicles) will be able to pass under the gantry in two lanes of traffic. Eastbound traffic will also be restored to two lanes. <br /><br />The developer has already been in contact with local residents associations to discuss these works and will also be carrying out an extensive letter drop in the area.

Officers from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea became suspicious when another claim from a different person was started at the same address in Earl&#39;s Court.  Further investigation revealed that Ms Ansari was living at an address in Acton W3 with her husband and that she was illegally subletting the property in Earl&#39;s Court Road.  <br /><br />It also transpired that she had bought a share in another property, had worked at both the Council and also in other employment and was also claiming working tax and child tax credit without declaring her full circumstances.  Ms Ansari also used her sister&#39;s name to buy property and apply for benefits and had two national insurance numbers.<br /><br />The judge sentenced Miss Ansari for 16 breaches of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and said that her fraud would usually have meant a custodial sentence but because of her early guilty plea and her mental health history, two mental health workers accompanied her to the court, he would not imprison her.  <br /><br />The judge sentenced her to pay £3,900 in compensation and gave her an eight month prison sentance, suspended for two years, with a two year supervision order with the probation office.

The second phase of the scheme to convert these 13 units was completed at the beginning of June.   <br /><br />The homes for sale comprise a mix of studio and one, two and three-bedroom flats.   Not only will the proceeds of their sale fund the social housing element of the scheme, the flats themselves will help meet the strong demand for homes in Chelsea. To date seven of the basements have been sold.  <br /><br />The properties fell into disrepair during the war years and were compulsorily purchased by Chelsea Borough Council in 1949.  Records show that, by then, the basements were already vacant.  Over time they came to house communal heating systems, ducting, electricity units and much else besides.  In parts, they were also used by tenants for storage purposes.<br /><br />&#34;There have been formidable obstacles, legal, technical and practical, to bringing these basements back to life,&#34; said Councillor Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Housing Services.  He added:  &#34;I&#39;m delighted to see they have all been overcome.<br /><br />&#34;Elm Park Gardens has always been amongst the very best council housing in the country.

The new arrangements will boost the drive to improve literacy in the capital through increased access to children&#39;s libraries and specialised services such as regular homework clubs.<br /><br />It comes as councils across the country are axing vital library services, with as many as 25 libraries expected to be closed in the capital alone over the next 12 months.<br /><br />Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Leader Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell said: &#34;We want Tri-borough working to be about much more than just making reductions and this is a very encouraging example of how, by combining our management, we have been able to protect a frontline service and offer more choice as well. We hope to repeat this pattern when we share services in other areas.&#34;<br /><br />The proposals are being backed by the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries Ed Vaizey MP. &#34;When funding is short, it is important that local authorities find innovative ways to provide this vital service, said Mr Vaizey. &#34;Merging services across three boroughs is vastly preferable to library closures and I hope that other local authorities will come up with their own forward-looking plans for keeping libraries open.&#34;<br /><br />Councillors at three separate Cabinet meetings are set to debate the proposals which also include:<br />- Combining fostering and adoption services and youth offending services, with the creation of a single Local Safeguarding Children Board. In total this would save nearly £199,000 a year by 2014/15. <br />- Combining environment management teams in Hammersmith &#38; Fulham (H&#38;F) and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea saving £1.5 million with a 48 per cent reduction in senior management (14 posts). <br /><br />The library proposals are part of wider plans to combine some council services across the three boroughs in a bid to save £35 million a year by 2014/15. Adult, children&#39;s, environmental and corporate services are also expected to be combined with around 500 jobs going in management, back office and support roles. <br /><br />Westminster Council leader Cllr Colin Barrow said: &#34;In these tough times, sharing back office functions and management with our neighbouring councils to drive out needless cost is the sensible and practical course of action to deliver savings to local taxpayers and protect frontline services such as our libraries. <br /><br />&#34;Throughout this process, we will ensure that each council continues to commission its own services and local priorities will still be driven by local people.&#34;<br /><br />Collectively the three authorities must save £100 million by 2014/15. They have each signed a `Sovereignty Guarantee&#39; to safeguard local autonomy, responsiveness and identity. Each of the councils will retain their own councillors and decision making processes. Services key to local areas, such as housing management, licensing and planning will be not be combined.<br /><br />Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea have agreed to share a chief executive from October 2011. The two councils already share senior management posts in legal services, highways and finance.<br /><br />Cllr Greg Smith, H&#38;F Council Cabinet Member for Residents&#39; Services, said: &#34;When money is tight some organisation&#39;s first reaction is to slash services and try to shift the blame. Others think innovatively and develop solutions that save money, increase choice and improve services so they are more accessible and convenient for residents. <br /><br />&#34;Literacy is a fundamental cornerstone of a modern society and we need to get youngsters off their sofas and into our libraries. This is why we are finding original ways to strengthen and protect as many of our libraries as we can.

However, to keep traffic moving on the route there will be some temporary changes to the way roads in the area can be used. <br /><br />Among these changes will be a special lane for official Games vehicles (the athletes, officials, media and others) as well as restrictions on turns into roads, some parking and loading suspensions and changes to bus lanes and stops. Where there is a Games Lane, a separate lane will still be available for general traffic.  You can see a map of the route and further information provided by TfL at www.tfl.gov.uk/ORN<br /><br />TfL will be writing to 22,000 households and businesses located within a 400m radius of the route in August 2011 to provide further information.<br /><br />Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, Cabinet Member for Transportation, said: &#34;The ORN is going to play a vital part in making sure that athletes and officials can get to their events in time during the Games.

It consistently shows the good things our young people are capable of.&#34;<br /><br />So far the group has raised nearly £6,500 for their expedition. This has involved them raising money around Portobello Market dressed in only their pyjamas! <br /><br />They were also successful in gaining funds from the Duke of Edinburgh Award Jubilee Fund, and are also planning a fun day in Westfield Park in September. <br /><br />The mums plan to go to Holland for their assessment expedition in May 2012.

These offences related to a lack of traceability for caviar, a failure to keep the premises clean, in good repair and a lack of a food safety management system. <br /><br />Mr Shedy told the court that he had been trading for 30 years and that in recent years his business had been suffering with the introduction of the congestion charge. It was also explained that he has now taken matters very seriously and this month had completed a food hygiene course. A certificate to confirm this was presented to District Judge Williams.<br /><br />In sentencing, Judge Williams said she had to increase the penalty from the previous conviction as this obviously was not effective. She also commented that the food produced at this premises looked appetizing so she was horrified to see the conditions it was produced in, and she could not believe that dairy products were being kept at 21 °C, given that this is a temperature that is regarded as being comfortable to work in an office environment, the fridges were clearly of little use.<br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &#34;Clearly the hygiene standards at Reza Patisserie fell way short of what is expected.  The public have a right to expect the food they buy to have been stored and prepared in clean conditions.

The customer who sufferers from a severe nut allergy checked the label and walnuts were not listed in the ingredients or on the label. Shortly after she bought the product, she bit into it and immediately realised that it contained nuts and suffered an allergic reaction, and was admitted to hospital for eight hours in order to be stabilised. The customer sent an email to Whole Foods and copied it to the Council&#39;s Environmental Health Food team complaining about the incident.<br /><br />Whole Foods told the court that this has never happened before and that they have since served over two million customers where it has not happened. Prior to this incident they already had a set of systems in place which addressed the handling of known food allergens, and they believed that the incident was caused by an oversight in which walnuts were accidentally omitted. Following the incident they reviewed their labelling process and have added even tighter controls on the store operations side of the business. <br /><br />In sentencing District Judge Jeremy Colman said he was impressed with the steps taken by the business. However, the consequences of this matter could have been very different. Thankfully the victim has now made a full recovery. This was a rather unfortunate situation for all those concerned and having considered all the evidence he saw fit to fine Whole Foods Market. <br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &#34;The public have a right to expect the food they buy is correctly and properly labelled and the fine imposed by the court reflects the seriousness of the failure to label food properly.  I am pleased that Whole Foods has reviewed its processes following this incident.  If any resident thinks a food product has been labelled incorrectly they should report it to the Council&#39;s Environmental Health Food Team.&#34;<br /><br />In addition to the fine the company was ordered to pay £2,321.03 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Whole Foods","Nut allergy","Whole Foods Market, Kensington High Street","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmi","cllr Fiona buxton","Whole Foods Market, Kensington High Street was fined £2,000 for failing to inform a customer about the presence of walnuts in one of its products.","Whole Foods Market fined £2,000 for misleading food label"

Thirty of these will be large family homes available through social renting, with the remainder smaller properties for shared ownership.<br /><br />The provision of new housing was a condition of the development of land at Holland Park School. The planning permission for the school&#39;s redevelopment created an obligation to develop 63 units of affordable housing on the Council-owned Silchester Garages site. <br /><br />Peabody will receive a grant of £2,925,000 from the Council, financed from the sale of part of the Holland Park School site.<br /><br />The development will help the Council meet its targets for the delivery of new housing of all tenures in the borough. The proposals extend further than the existing planning permission, and will involve the demolition of fourteen one-bedroom flats to enable an extra 15 social rented homes, six shared ownership and 28 homes for market sale to be built.  It will also contribute to the regeneration of the Latimer area through improved urban design and a more balanced tenure mix.<br /><br />Councillor Timothy Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Housing, said: &#34;Good quality affordable housing is in great demand in the borough and this development will help to address this need. I am very pleased that we have been able to select Peabody to develop these much needed homes in North Kensington.&#34;<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","silchester garages site","Affordable homes","cllr  coleridge",,,"Much needed affordable new homes will be provided following a decision last night (Thursday 22 September) by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet to choose Peabody as its development partner to build 63 new homes on the Silchester Garages site.

The work was undertaken by the Royal Borough Environment Project after an extensive public consultation.<br /><br />The improvements included completely relandscaping the area, adding new surfaces and plants, thinning the thick tree canopy and adding new play and art features.  <br /><br />The artwork at the front of the site is a memorial to local author and philosopher John Michell and was donated by his friends. <br /><br />Fr. Jonathan Brownsell, parish priest of All Saints Church, has other reasons to cheer as his church, which owns the land and leases it Notting Hill Housing Group,  is marking its 150th anniversary and he is celebrating his 35th anniversary as parish priest.  <br /><br />Praising the community collaboration, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said: &#34;What better way to celebrate All Saint&#39;s 150 anniversary than to transform this underused corner of the area into a bright pocket park with something for all local residents whether they are one or 100-years old.

There is now an impressive alliance of councils, MPs and London Assembly Members, cutting across political parties, supporting us.  These are joined by local businesses, social landlords and residents&#39; groups who all see the massive opportunity to improve public transport and boost the local economy. <br /><br />&#34;I hope that those in London and national government, who will eventually make the decision, will see the benefit that this station will bring and deliver Crossrail for Kensal.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Ann John OBE, Brent Council Leader, said: &#34;Brent Council supports the development of a Crossrail station in the Kensal area. The station would greatly improve public transport for residents and businesses in the south of Brent. The station would mean residents living in areas as Kensal Green, Kensal Rise and Harlesden would be linked to all of London by the most up-to-date public transport system. <br /><br />&#34;In addition, the building and development of such a major transport infrastructure project would help to not only regenerate Kensington and Chelsea but the south of Brent as well, offering significant new opportunities in terms of jobs and housing for many of our residents.&#34;<br /><br />A station in Kensal would transform accessibility in an area poorly served by public transport and help trigger a major development of the 67 acre former gas works site which is capable of accommodating more than 2,500 new homes as well as new business and community facilities.<br /><br />The proposals have received much support since Kensington and Chelsea Council announced earlier this year that it had committed to underwrite the £33m construction costs. MPs Karen Buck, Sarah Teather and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, and London Assembly member Jenny Jones, are all behind a new station. London Deputy Mayor Kit Malthouse described the case for Kensal Crossrail as &#34;overwhelming&#34;. Other supporters include National Grid, Portobello Antiques Dealers&#39; Association, Cath Kidston, Westway Development Trust, Kensington and Chelsea Chamber of Commerce and Sainsbury&#39;s.<br /><br />For full details of the Council&#39;s proposals for Kensal Crossrail, go to www.rbkc.gov.uk/crossrail <br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Crossrail","Kensal crossrail","brent","Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell",,"The Royal Borough&#39;s plan to bring a Crossrail station to North Kensington is now being supported by neighbouring Brent Council.","Brent backs plans for Kensal Crossrail"

These include the City Academy Hackney, the Skinners Academy Hackney, the Ark Academy Wembley, and sports centres in Watford, in Bathgate and for the American Community School in Cobham.<br /><br />As well as being familiar with the challenges of building schools and leisure centres, Studio E is also familiar with the Royal Borough.  In 1999 it was responsible for the award winning redesign of Emslie Horniman Pleasance, in 2003 it designed the classroom of the future at St Francis of Assisi primary school and more recently it completed the eye-catching sports and IT extension to St Charles Catholic Sixth Form College.<br /><br />More than 40 firms entered the competition to design the new academy and leisure centre.  Studio E was selected from a shortlist of six, following presentations to a panel of councillors together with a representative of the Council&#39;s co-sponsor.  The shortlisted designs were also on show to local residents at an exhibition earlier this month. Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Environment and Leisure and Chairman of the selection panel, said: &#34;The shortlisted designs showed some real energy and ingenuity. We drew great encouragement from them that we will be able to deliver a fine new school and leisure centre for the people of North Kensington.&#34;<br /><br />Studio E will now develop a series of design options for the academy and leisure centre.  These will be reviewed by a new community panel consisting of local residents and groups during the autumn before they are presented to the Council&#39;s Cabinet in December when a final decision will be taken as to whether or not the project can proceed.<br /><br />Subject to Cabinet approval, the designs will then form a planning application that is expected to be submitted in April 2012.  This will be subject to a full programme of pre-submission consultation with local residents in early 2012.  There will also be further statutory consultation as part of the legal requirements of seeking planning permission in the borough.  A decision by the Council&#39;s Planning Committee is then expected in the summer of 2012. <br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","KaLC","Kensington academy","Leisure centre","studio e","cllr Paget-Brown","The competition to design a new academy and leisure centre for North Kensington has been won by a Studio E-led team that includes sports and leisure specialists LA Architects as well as building engineers Max Fordham and Curtin and Churchman landscape architects.","Winning architect announced for academy and leisure centre"

This includes saving:<br /> £320k by sharing a single Director of Children&#39;s Services; <br /> £320k by sharing a single Director of Adult Services;<br /> £100k by sharing a single Director of Libraries;<br /> £150k by combining environmental services across Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea; and <br /> £120k by making a joint appointment to the Director for Schools&#39; Quality and Standards between Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea.<br /> <br />This news comes as they publish a new analysis of the potential for shared services focusing on seven lessons learnt during the first year of Tri-borough working. The guide to encourage innovation and sharing services was launched at an event with Eric Pickles MP, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.<br /><br />The proposals will protect vital front line services at a time of necessary financial adjustment and will lead to a 50 per cent reduction in the number of middle and senior managers. There will also be a 50 per cent reduction in the overheads attached to front line services to the public. <br /> <br />In the pamphlet `Driving change: leadership, trust and money&#39; they show the success to date of the Tri-borough plan to combine services, including `strong leadership, a robust business case and momentum to change&#39;. <br /> <br />Commenting on the publication of the report, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of Kensington and Chelsea said: &#34;Our initial success shows that our approach offers lessons to other local authorities wanting to follow our lead. It has not been easy but the right mixture of strong political drive, excellent officer advice, high trust, comprehensive communications and forensic attention to the business case for sharing services has already resulted in impressive results. &#34;  <br /><br />Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Cllr Stephen Greenhalgh commented: &#34;Residents expect us to strain every sinew to deliver better services with fewer resources. One of the ways we can protect the front line is to strip out unnecessary and duplicated management overheads. This report shows how, by sharing the top jobs, it is possible to reduce the bill for senior managers by millions of pounds.&#34;<br />  <br />Colin Barrow, Leader of Westminster added: &#34;These proposals offer a better way than cutting services to meet the £100m savings target facing the three councils.  <br /> <br />&#34;Our residents will be able to access the best the other boroughs have to offer.  We will keep vital services like libraries open and make over one million books available to people across the three boroughs.  Our first joint campaign - `Summer in the City&#39; has already offered over 200 summer activities to families from all three councils.   <br /> <br />&#34;And we will do all this while making big savings through combining top and middle management jobs.&#34;    <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Tri-borough","Savings ","sharing services ","Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea","The Leaders of three leading councils announced Monday 3 October that the project to share council services across Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Westminster is on track to realise its first £1m of savings by cutting senior management roles.

(Wednesday 19 October).<br /><br />The move, which will save the two authorities some £200,000 a year, is the latest in a series of senior management shares between three west London councils.<br /><br />In May this year Westminster, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea agreed radical plans to combine a range of services. Children&#39;s services, adult social care and libraries are already in the process of being shared and single `Tri-borough&#39; directors have been appointed for each. Under the plan, there will be approximately 500 management and back office jobs lost across the three boroughs.<br /><br />The overall proposals are expected to save taxpayers in the three authorities £33.4 million by 2014/15 while leading to improvements in many areas. For example, residents will have access to all 21 libraries, with more than one million books, hundreds of entertainment and cultural events and scores of weekly skills and education classes on offer.<br /><br />While more services are likely to be combined across the three authorities, in some cases it has proved more practicable for now to share between Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea.<br /><br />Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham will not only share a Chief Executive, but also the management and delivery of environmental services such as waste management, leisure, transportation, licensing and environmental heath. The two boroughs already share a director of legal services and a director of transportation and highways.<br /><br />&#34;If we are going to protect our frontline services then management and back offices must take the brunt of the savings programme,&#34; explained the Leader of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell. &#34;The savings go right to the very top, and one of the reasons that is possible is because in Derek Myers we have someone capable of taking on the role of dual chief executive, notwithstanding its scale and complexity.&#34;<br /><br />Before joining Kensington and Chelsea, Derek Myers was Chief Executive at the London Borough of Hounslow and before that its director of social services. He holds degrees in economics and law and is a qualified social worker.<br /><br />Derek replaces Geoff Alltimes CBE who is retiring after more than 30 years of service. Geoff has been Chief Executive since 2002 having previously worked as Director of Social Services. Between April 2009 and October 2010 he was chief executive of both Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council and NHS Hammersmith &#38; Fulham. Geoff joined the Council in 1976 as a social worker team leader.<br /><br />Geoff is continuing his work for the independent NHS Future Forum, the group commissioned by the Government to listen to the views of patients, staff and the public in looking at ways to modernise the NHS.<br /><br />Cllr Stephen Greenhalgh, Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, said: &#34;At a time when the state of the nation&#39;s finances mean that we have to save millions of pounds, our residents can be assured that we are doing everything possible to cut back office and management costs, not the services they rely on the most.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Greenhalgh also paid tribute to Mr Alltimes by saying: &#34;Geoff has devoted his life to public service in Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and has been a major force in bringing down the Berlin Wall that existed between health and social care. While he will be sorely missed, the improvements he helped bring about in the way we care for elderly and vulnerable people will leave a lasting legacy.&#34;<br /><br />Mr Alltimes is due to retire on 31 October.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Derek Myers","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea","Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell","bi-borough","Hammersmith &#38; Fulham","Two of Britain&#39;s best local authorities now share a single Chief Executive, following a joint appointment at Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea.","Two boroughs, one Chief Executive"

It has already paid dividends for a number of local communities.<br /> <br />In the St Charles ward, in the north of the borough residents addressed the problem caused by the anti-social behaviour of some young people in the Dalgarno area and established an Air Cadets programme, ran a local football tournament and developed a youth outreach scheme.<br /> <br />In Golborne, locals opted for a &#34;loveGolborne&#34; campaign to encourage local pride and increase tourism and promote the Golborne Market. Like-minded Colville ward residents opted to set up a forum so Councillors and local people could discuss what projects they wanted to prioritise. As a result, they are now running a number of community gardening ventures. <br /><br />At the launch event residents suggested a broad range of potential ideas, from more and better advertised volunteering opportunities, through examining the possibility of neighbourhood planning, to creating a new cycle route through Holland Park. Councillors and officers will be analysing all the ideas and responses, and will make sure to follow up with everyone that left their contact details.<br /> <br />Cabinet Member for Civil Society, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen said: &#34;I want to encourage all residents and community groups to contact their local Councillors and discuss with them how they could work together and use these funds to benefit their local area.   <br /> <br />&#34;There is no limit to the number of projects that may be agreed by a ward provided it is within budget.

Now is the time to begin planning how your business can take full advantage of the Games. However, like any large event, the Games will bring some challenges. If your business is near an Olympic venue or a travel hotspot, you need to start planning as soon as possible to reduce any adverse impact the Games might have on your business.  <br /><br />Kensington and Chelsea is hosting the Olympic volleyball tournament at Earl&#39;s Court and more than 12,000 people are expected to attend  each day of the 16 days of competition between Saturday 28 July and Sunday 12 August.

This will mean that roads in the borough and other parts of west London and out to Surrey, will be closed. While the event will attract thousands of spectators along its route traffic and bus routes will be severely affected. <br /><br />Between 28 July and 5 August the Royal Borough will be staging a spectacular festival to celebrate the Games and the Royal Borough&#39;s cultural and scientific heritage in Exhibition Road. <br />The Government has produced a guide, `Preparing your business for the Games&#39;, with contributions from all the organisations involved with delivering the Olympics. It will be reviewed regularly during the next year, so please visit www.london2012.com/business to get the latest advice.

This will give local residents and businesses a chance to welcome the Olympic flame just before the Games begin.<br /><br />Kensington and Chelsea is one of over 1,000 villages, towns, cities and London boroughs announced by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) through which the Olympic Flame will be carried by torchbearers during the London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay which is presented by Coca-Cola, Lloyds TSB and Samsung.  LOCOG has worked closely with representatives from a number of sectors in Kensington and Chelsea to devise the route which will travel through each of the 33 London boroughs as part of its journey.<br /><br />Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;I am sure that the Olympic Torch Relay will be an exciting spectacle. It will give residents and businesses an opportunity to get into the Olympic spirit and to salute the torchbearers, many of whom will be local heroes, nominated by the public, with inspirational stories to tell.<br /><br />&#34;It will be an excellent chance to celebrate the Royal Borough&#39;s heritage and the different cultures that make up our community.&#34;<br /><br />Sebastian Coe, Chair of LOCOG said: `We are thrilled to confirm that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea will act as a host location for the Olympic flame on 26 July extending an invitation to people across the borough to welcome the Olympic Torch Relay during its journey around the UK.  This is the UK&#39;s moment to shine and I want to encourage people in Kensington and Chelsea to start planning how they can be part of this once in a lifetime opportunity and show their support for the inspirational torchbearers chosen to carry the Olympic flame as we count down to the start of the Olympic Games.<br /><br />The Olympic Torch Relay will start at Land&#39;s End, Cornwall on the morning of 19 May 2012. On leaving Land&#39;s End, the Olympic flame will travel an estimated 8,000 miles around the UK. <br /><br />In announcing the villages, towns, cities and every London borough, LOCOG has realised the aspiration of taking the Olympic flame to within an hour&#39;s journey time of 95 per cent of the population. In fact, over 95 per cent of the population will be within just ten miles of the Olympic flame next summer. The street by street detail of the route will be confirmed next year. <br /><br />People are invited to view the interactive map at www.london2012.com/olympictorchrelaymap to find their nearest community through which the Olympic Flame will be carried.

The Council is worried that not only would this result in a sharp increase in noise and nuisance for Royal Borough residents, but a spike in associated antisocial behaviour.<br /><br />Another implication for the Royal Borough is that it hosts one of Europe&#39;s largest events, the Notting Hill Carnival.  In the interests of public safety it is essential that the Council and the Metropolitan Police bring Carnival to a close at a reasonable hour.  With complete deregulation any premises within the Carnival area could legally provide live and recorded music 24 hours a day over the Carnival period, as long as any alcohol sales they make are within their permitted hours and their audiences are not more than 5,000. <br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Environment, said:<br /><br />&#34;Far from being meddlesome, pointless bureaucracy, entertainment licences are actually how we ensure that noise is controlled, that events close down at a reasonable time and that landlords generally act responsibly.<br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s no secret that councils and constabularies are hard pressed right now and indeed for the foreseeable future.  We for one simply do not have the resources to cope with a serious rise in complaints and urge the DCMS to rethink its proposals.<br /><br />&#34;In addition to our formal response to the consultation, I have written to the Secretary of State at the DCMS to express the Council&#39;s grave concern about the adverse impact this proposal will have on densely populated inner-city residential areas like Kensington and Chelsea.&#34;<br /><br />You can have your say on the consultation by visiting www.culture.gov.uk/consultations and clicking on the link entitled &#34;Consultation on proposal to examine the deregulation of Schedule One of the Licensing Act 2003&#34;.<br /><br />The consultation closes on Saturday 3 December 2011.

But after that Capital and Counties (Capco), the owners of both Earls Court 1 and 2, are considering redevelopment.  <br /><br />At the same time, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham is looking at the regeneration of the adjoining West Kensington and Gibbs Green Council housing estates.  Similarly Transport for London is looking at options for its Lillie Bridge rail depot.  The three sites together amount to just over 77 acres, which is larger than the King&#39;s Cross redevelopment, making it a site of immense potential.  <br /><br />To make sure that the right development occurs in the right place, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, together with the Mayor of London, are drawing up a planning framework for the area.   <br /><br />This detailed document, called a Supplementary Planning Document (SPD), takes into account a whole range of issues, from affordable housing provision to transport capacity, open space, community facilities and the size, location, design and layout of any new buildings, public spaces and streets. It will also set out a series of requirements to reduce the impact of building work on neighbouring residents and the environment, such as air quality, noise and vibration.  The SPD also seeks to improve access between the two boroughs.  <br /><br />A first draft of the planning framework was published for consultation earlier this year (March to April 2011) and comments from residents, businesses and visitors were used to revise this planning framework.  Now the boroughs and the Mayor of London want to know what you think about the revised draft planning framework. This planning framework will be used to determine planning applications in the area.<br /><br />Residents have until Friday 23 December to have their say on this important planning document.

Under the obligation, developers must demonstrate that they have at least 70 per cent of the necessary development funds in place before they can start the work. <br /><br />With major backing from the Conran Foundation, plus support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Design Museum was already 85 per cent of the way to meeting the terms. But the rest of the money is mostly tied up in the museum&#39;s current building at Shad Thames and can only be realised once the Design Museum relocates to Kensington. In other words, the Design Museum can&#39;t sell up at Shad Thames until it has moved to Kensington, but it can&#39;t move to Kensington until it has sold up at Shad Thames.  <br /><br />A Council loan resolves this Catch-22 and, subject to planning permission, could enable the museum to complete the move to Kensington High Street if other sources of funds are slow to appear.<br /><br />&#34;If the Design Museum chooses to take this offer up, this is a low risk, short-term loan with a potentially big return,&#34; explained the  Leader of the Council, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell. &#34;Not only will we get interest, we will improve the odds of a museum making use of the Institute. That would mean major economic benefits for the High Street and it would also mean the restoration of a wonderful listed building.&#34;<br /><br />Completed in 1962, the Commonwealth Institute is a Grade II* listed building, noted for its marquee-like copper roof.  It has been empty since 2002. The Design Museum submitted a planning application for a £22m refurbishment of the building last month.  If granted, the Museum plans to relocate to the Institute in 2014.     <br /><br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","commonwealth insitute ","design museum","Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell","Royal borough of kensingtion and chelsea ","Conran Foundation","The Design Museum&#39;s ambitions to move into the Commonwealth Institute achieved a big step towards financial viability last night (17 November 2011), thanks to the offer of a £2.6m loan from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.","Loan to aid Design Museum move"

The court was told that the woman had previous convictions for a similar offence in 2009 involving the same son and that her eldest son is currently serving a prison sentence.<br /><br />Sentencing the woman, who had pleaded not guilty, District Judge Clarke said she had no mitigation and that he had enough of all the &#34;tears and excuses&#34;.  He said &#34;the time for action has come&#34; and that the matter needed &#34;finality&#34; and there had been too much concentration on her as the mother and not enough on the son.<br /><br />Suspending the sentence he took the unusual step to impose conditions on her sentence.  She is to co-operate with the Education Welfare Service of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and to attend all appointments made for the purpose of getting her son back into school.  She must ensure that he attends school at least 90 per cent of the time.  She must provide medical evidence to the school on any occasion her son is considered too ill to attend and must do so within seven days of his not attending.   She was also ordered to pay a contribution of £150 to the Council&#39;s costs of £5,000 due to the fact she was on benefits and had been recently evicted from Council housing due to antisocial behaviour and rent arrears.<br /><br />The court was told that education welfare officers were working with the boy to ensure he had support to settle back into school and make up for the time he had missed.<br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Education, said: &#34;Parents have a duty to ensure that their children attend school.  A good education is vital for any child&#39;s development and welfare.  This is clearly a case of a parent failing to ensure that her son went to school and the court has taken a dim view of the mother&#39;s actions.

It will reflect all the latest and best practice in children&#39;s homes.  In particular there will be greatly improved internal and external space for social and recreational use. <br /> <br />Once the new home is built the present home at Whistler Walk, at World&#39;s End, will close.<br /><br />As a home, Whistler Walk has long been praised by inspectors for its exceptional standards of care.  As a building however, it leaves much to be desired.  Built in the 1970s, the internal layout feels institutional and doesn&#39;t easily lend itself to the creation of a homely, family atmosphere.  This fundamental problem cannot be addressed by a refurbishment. <br /><br />Councillor Baroness Ritchie, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;Despite living in straitened times, with pressure on the public purse, we must ensure our most disadvantaged children get the best possible care and accommodation. <br /><br />&#34;We could certainly have opted for a refurbishment of the existing home, but this is an opportunity to do something far better, perhaps even to set a new standard.  And that is what we have chosen to do.  We will have a brand new home, on a park corner, near schools and leisure facilities.  <br /> <br />&#34;These are our most disadvantaged children; we mean to do our best for them.&#34;<br /> <br />Over a 30 year span, about 300 children will benefit from the new home.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL"," Whistler walk"," looked after children"," east Row"," Councillor Ritchie",,"Future generations of looked after children in Kensington and Chelsea are to have a brand new, state of the art children&#39;s home, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet decided last night ( Thursday 17 November).","New £3 million home for borough&#39;s looked after children"

Our Parks team is looking forward to delivering them in the coming weeks.  I think they will be a living reminder of the Diamond Jubilee and it is a marvellous way to mark such a wonderful occasion.&#34;<br /><br />The Lord-Lieutenant said: &#34;The black poplar initiative epitomises the inclusivity that I am seeking to bring to next year&#39;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations and I hope that all 7.5 million residents in the 32 boroughs will become involved.

Visual and tactile lines distinguish pedestrian areas from those used by vehicles. Cars are slowed by a 20mph speed limit. <br /><br />A stunning chequered granite design runs from South Kensington Station to Hyde Park along the full width of the road from building to building. Kerbs, barriers and street clutter have been removed improving access, particularly for those using wheelchairs, push chairs and motorised buggies. Pedestrians can now walk from South Kensington Station to Hyde Park along a newly created shared space. <br /><br />Black cast iron drainage channel covers run along each side of Exhibition Road, about four metres out from the respective building lines. Beside the drainage channels, strips of `corduroy&#39; tactile warn blind and partially sighted people that they are moving into or out of vehicle free areas.<br /><br />Tall, sleek street lighting masts have been designed to complement the grand buildings of Exhibition Road.<br /><br />The reopening is being marked by a small ceremony to thank the staff and craftspeople who made it possible and the local people who supported the project.  The official reopening ceremony will take place on 1 February 2012. <br /><br />Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;It has taken us the best part of ten years to get here but South Kensington and Exhibition Road finally have the setting they deserve.  <br /><br />&#34;For 2012 and far beyond, London now has a unique streetscape that will delight our many millions of visitors and which sets a new standard for urban design.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Daniel Moylan, Deputy Chairman of Transport for London (TfL), said: &#34;The improvements made to this cultural heartland of the Capital are exactly what the Mayor of London&#39;s Great Outdoors programme is seeking to achieve.<br /><br />&#34;The reimagining of the space has transformed Exhibition Road, improving the quality of life for people living and working in, and for those visiting, the borough.  In addition, the uplift in local retail has helped nearby business and dramatically improved the pedestrian experience.<br /><br />&#34;It is a great example of how TfL and the boroughs are contributing to transform the streets and public spaces in the Capital in advance of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&#34;<br /><br />Leader of Westminster Council, Cllr Colin Barrow, added: &#34;The project at Exhibition Road has made a dramatic impact on the South Kensington streetscape and we are delighted to see the successful completion of these improvements.

Louisa explained that the Award had made such a huge impact on her that she decided to become a youth worker, giving more young people the chance to do it. Louisa is currently leading the UK&#39;s first group of young mums through their Gold DofE Award.<br /><br />Louisa said, &#34;I wanted to give teenage mums the chance to do their DofE. It was going to be a challenge, but it would give them the chance to get back on their feet, gain skills and eventually get into work. We started with the bronze, taking their babies on expedition. Now they are doing their Gold, the babies are children, and the mums are all working, in education or training.&#34;<br /><br />HRH The Countess of Wessex, said:  &#34;We hear about the number of young people out of work, education or training on a daily basis and I believe the DofE has never been more relevant. We know that employers look for the DofE on young people&#39;s CVs, it could help them get that essential first job.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Baroness Ritchie, Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;I am very pleased that young people in the borough are taking on the challenge of completing their Duke of Edinburgh Awards under Louisa&#39;s guidance.

Similarly, only advertisers which obtain approval will be able to advertise in these areas, with the deadline for public applications also being 29 February 2012. <br /><br />The rules, now online, will ensure that spectators and those taking part in the Olympic and Paralympic Games can access venues easily and safely, and that the Games have a consistent look, without unauthorised marketing close to Earls Court and along the route of the cycle road race.<br /><br />Restrictions on advertising and outdoor trading are a requirement of the contracts that host cities sign with the International Olympic Committee. They are now common practice at major international sporting events. <br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &#34;I would urge all businesses close to Earls Court and along Knightsbridge, Brompton Road and Fulham Road to familiarise themselves with the restrictions on outdoor trading and advertising that will be enforced throughout the Olympic Games.&#34;<br /><br />London 2012&#39;s website - www.london2012.com/advertisingandtrading - <br />explains where the rules on advertising and outdoor trading near venues will be implemented (with a postcode checker), how they will be enforced and when they will apply. It spells out the application process and criteria for authorisation, includes a detailed guide and shows examples of practices that do not require authorisation, or that can only be carried out if authorisation has been obtained.  <br /><br />The Advertising and Trading Regulations cover all trading in open public places within `Event Zones&#39; during the periods in question - including roads and any land that the public has access to, and all forms of advertising. However, a number of exceptions mean that certain forms of trading and advertising do not require authorisation.<br /><br />Examples of activities where no authorisation is required are deliveries of food and newspapers, advertising on buses and taxis carrying passengers through an Event Zone, advertising inside a building, and most existing shop signage. <br /><br />Authorisation has to be obtained for open air trading activities including selling from temporary buildings like marquees, busking and collecting for charity. It will also have to be obtained for advertising on billboards and poster sites, for example, but authorisation will be reserved primarily for sponsors of the Games.  <br /><br />Advertising that is not expected to be permitted includes advertising by non-sponsors which aim to engage in `ambush marketing&#39;, such as temporary advertising, distributing direct advertising literature, and arranging for advertising giveaways in an Event Zone. <br /><br />The public application process for advertising is open until the end of February 2012, and applications can be made to the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) by email or post. <br /><br />Applications for permission to trade outdoors need to be made to the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) by the same date and will shortly be able to be made online. There is a right to ask for a review of the two organisations&#39; decisions by the ODA, which is a public body.<br />The ODA is responsible for enforcement of the Regulations around Earls Court and along the route of the road cycle race.   <br />ODA Chief Executive, Dennis Hone, said: &#34;Our aim is to make sure that spectators can get to watch the sport they have paid for - without delay and without risk. That means limiting, for just a few weeks next summer, advertising and trading in public places on roads and pavements in the busiest areas close to Earls Court and along the cycle road race course.

The Games will have an impact on roads and public transport in Kensington and Chelsea, particularly in the Earl&#39;s Court area and along the route of the Olympic cycle road races.<br /><br />TfL has developed an online planning tool, available at www.tfl.gov.uk/2012, to help people understand where and when roads will be at their busiest.  This shows the additional journey time for those road journeys between various areas across London, at different times of the day.  For example, in the morning peak, TfL expects journeys between Notting Hill and Wandsworth to increase by 30 minutes.&#34; <br /><br />According to TfL around 70 per cent of Greater London&#39;s road traffic will be unaffected. <br /><br />Days 1, 2, 6, 8 and 11 of the Games look particularly busy in the borough and would be good days to avoid driving in Kensington and Chelsea if possible. Severe disruption will be experienced on days 1 and 2 due to the Olympic cycle road races which take place that weekend with Knightsbridge, Brompton Road and Fulham Road closed to traffic and many other roads affected. <br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, the Deputy Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said: &#34;It is clear that as well as being an exciting spectacle the Olympic Games will mean more traffic on certain roads and busier stations on parts of the network.  The way to minimise the impact of this is to plan ahead.  TfL will be providing information on its website in the run up to and during the Games themselves and I would encourage residents and businesses to look carefully at this information.&#34;<br /><br />TfL expects that two thirds of Tube and DLR stations will see no impact in terms of additional time taken to board a train.

This decision amounts to a massive £57.8m investment in the Notting Barns ward - one of the most deprived parts of the Royal Borough.<br /><br />Demand for school places in the north of the borough is high, and a new school will help to address this shortage.  The Government has already pledged £17.6m towards building the new academy and the Council has committed an additional £10.4m to ensure the school is built to the same high standard as Chelsea Academy.  Co-sponsored by the Council, the lead sponsor of the academy is the Aldridge Foundation. The academy will seek to embed entrepreneurship and expressive arts at the heart of the curriculum.<br /><br />The Council has also decided to commit £24.7m towards building a new leisure centre.  The current leisure centre was built in the 1970s and is coming to the end of its useful life.  An option to refurbish the existing leisure centre was rejected after architects estimated that full refurbishment would cost in the region of £14m, and would only extend the centre&#39;s life by ten years. The brand new centre should last up to 50 years.  <br /><br />Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said:<br /><br />&#34;This decision is very good news for North Kensington and represents part of the Council&#39;s ongoing commitment to the redevelopment and regeneration of the area.  <br /><br />&#34;We are prepared to invest the cash necessary to really tackle the disparity between the north and south of the borough.  This initiative will not only help to address the shortage of school places but give the community brand new leisure facilities to enjoy for decades to come.  <br /><br />&#34;However, before we submit a planning application we have a lot more work ahead of us and promise that we will continue to involve and listen to people every step of the way.&#34; <br /><br />Following the Cabinet&#39;s decision, Chairman of the Aldridge Foundation, Rod Aldridge, said:<br /><br />&#34;The additional funding will enable us to provide an incredible Academy school for the young people of North Kensington and parents will be proud of the high standards we are aiming for.  It will also be a valuable community asset, from which the local residents will benefit.&#39;&#39;<br /><br />The preferred option also includes the provision of some new housing along Bomore Road.  A more detailed appraisal of this element of the project will be undertaken in the coming months.<br /><br />The Council&#39;s plans for an academy and leisure centre will then form a planning application that the Council aims to submit in June 2012. A decision by the Council&#39;s Planning Application Committee is then expected in the summer of 2012.<br /><br />For more information on the project please visit www.rbkc.gov.uk/kalc <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cabinet","royal borough of kensington and chelsea ","Academy","Aldridge Foundation ","Notting Barns ward ","Ambitious plans for a new school and leisure centre in North Kensington were given the go ahead last night (Monday 12 December) by the Cabinet of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

Each of the five trainees has gained their FA Level One coaching qualification and has completed over 120 hours of both practical coaching sessions with local primary schools, and a variety of coach development sessions. <br /><br />The scheme acts as a stepping stone to part-time employment and apprenticeship opportunities within the local community. Local employers such as Westway Sports Centre, QPR Community Sports Trust, Chelsea FC Community Foundation, New Hope Academy and Active Planet have all supported this programme and have integrated young coaches into their programmes.<br /><br />Leroy Gravesande, one of the five trainees, said: &#34;This scheme has given me the confidence and abilities I need in order to progress and become a better football coach.

The type of equipment available includes raised toilet seats to help with getting on and off the toilet, bath boards to help get in and out of the bath, walking sticks and a range of items to help in the kitchen.<br /><br />Residents, who have been assessed as eligible by Health or Social Services staff, will receive a `prescription&#39; entitling them to receive the equipment free of charge, from one of the accredited retailers.<br /><br />It is also possible to pay extra towards a version of the equipment that is more to individual taste. For example, a different model or a different colour to suit the home environment.<br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care and Non-executive Director at NHS Kensington &#38; Chelsea said: &#34;Sometimes a piece of simple equipment, or the right gadget, can make all the difference to a person&#39;s quality of life.  <br /><br />&#34;The accreditation scheme means that residents can visit local retailers, confident that they will receive accurate information on the equipment, whether they choose to buy it themselves or be assessed and receive a prescription.&#34;<br /><br />Prescriptions are only issued for simple aids to daily living. These are usually small items such as raised toilet seats which cost less than £100. Accredited retailers will supply a range of such items on the local high street. This equipment can also be bought, without a prescription, from retailers approved by the Council according to the Department of Health&#39;s national accreditation criteria.<br /><br />Larger pieces of equipment, known as `complex aids to daily living&#39;, are not available by prescription. These are things such as a battery-powered mobile hoist to help people get in and out of bed.  <br /><br />Residents who feel they may need this equipment can contact Social Servicesline on 020 7361 3013 or email socialservices@rbkc.gov.uk  and request an assessment.

The plan will also involve harnessing the passion of the voluntary sector and unlocking the vast potential of businesses to promote growth, reward ambition and reduce dependency.<br /> <br />In being awarded the prestigious Community Budget pilot Westminster, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea councils put forward a clear statement of ambition referred to as the `Tri-Government Guarantee&#39;, setting out targets for what could be achieved through better working across three tiers of government. Some of these targets include:<br />                                             <br /> Working together to ensure that every young person under 25 has a job or is in training or education<br /> A commitment to achieve educational excellence where 80 per cent of children across the three boroughs achieve five A*- C grade GCSEs including maths and English<br /> An assurance that people in the `squeezed middle&#39; (with a combined household income below £60k) have access to high-quality affordable housing<br /> <br />The pilot will involve radically redesigning services and aligning funding in a number of key areas over the next 12 months, with a view to possibly implementing the changes from December 2012 onwards. The key service areas will include: skills and training for over 16s, education, worklessness, speeding up family court proceedings, youth violence and anti-social behaviour.<br /> <br />The three councils have already demonstrated their ability to promote growth among businesses and reduce dependence on the state with a number of existing projects. These include:<br />                       <br /> Hub Westminster, London&#39;s largest start-up incubation lab for businesses providing premises for 1000 entrepreneurs, social enterprises and start-ups. Importantly, the programme was only realised through a detailed co-design process involving the council, social business and private sector investors.<br /> H&#38;F&#39;s JCP OnePlace initiative which placed council officers, including housing benefit advisers, in the job centre alongside other key debt and skills training advisers. The project achieved outstanding results, with 332 residents securing jobs because of OnePlace&#39;s early intervention. In October 2011, the Department for Work and Pensions Universal Credit team named H&#38;F the number one local authority for innovatively tackling worklessness and poverty, having visited 100 local authorities and shortlisted ten. <br /> Westminster&#39;s Family Recovery Programme also acted as a forerunner to the first round of Community Budget pilots by integrating a number of different agencies and social services to form a bespoke team around problem families to tackle the multiple challenges they might be facing - including domestic violence, serious youth violence and antisocial behaviour, worklessness and poor school attainment.<br /> In Kensington and Chelsea, the Royal Borough&#39;s long history of successful working with business, health, education, voluntary and housing sectors has delivered more than 70 apprenticeships and has attracted more than £2.5m in external funding to support projects such as youth services and an Open Age Centre delivering health and social care.<br /> All three authorities have also made impressive achievements on their cross-cutting work and skills agendas. Westminster Works has involved over 3000 residents and led to over 550 long-term jobs over a two-year period, while H&#38;F&#39;s Workzone has brokered jobs for 361 job seekers this calendar year and is now the leading London National Skills Academy (Retail) provider of small business master classes. Kensington and Cheslea also has a well developed Worklessness Network delivering a wide range of employment initiatives, including pre-employment programmes, support for the over 50s, careers fairs and work and enterprise clubs.<br /> <br />Commenting on the announcement, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:<br /> <br />&#34;We need to end the `silo control&#39; and start a local service revolution that puts people at the heart of spending decisions and saves the money needed to pay off the deficit.<br /> <br />&#34;[The three west London boroughs] are one of four `pool to save&#39; pioneers that can bring about truly local services that knock out bureaucratic processes everywhere and upend Whitehall&#39;s monopoly over public money that&#39;s hemmed in frontline workers for decades.&#34;<br /> <br />Cllr Colin Barrow, Leader of Westminster City Council, added:<br /> <br />&#34;This is about budgeting for real life and we welcome this new common-sense approach to funding which enables us to further promote growth and reduce dependency across the three boroughs. Our current projects including the Family Recovery Programme and Hub Westminster have already demonstrated our innovation, but the realigning of funding under Community Budgets gives us the potential to do so much more.&#34;<br /> <br />Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, said:<br />                           <br />&#34;This is an opportunity for the Government, councils and other local services to break the mould so that public money can deliver better value, better results and better lives for local people. The Royal Borough has set the benchmark for successful budgeting and innovative service delivery for many years.

This means they are approved and security-checked with the relevant qualifications and insurance.<br /><br />A full list of RDI installers in Kensington and Chelsea can be found at www.rdi-lb.tv or by calling the Digital UK advice line on 08456 50 50 50. If householders cannot find a local RDI installer, they are advised to look for an installer registered with the Confederation of Aerial Industries&#39; CAI Plus scheme. More information can be found at www.digitaluk.co.uk<br /><br />From Wednesday 4 April 2012, the London TV region will start switching to digital television. <br /><br />Digital UK and local Trading Standards officers are offering these five facts to help viewers avoid getting ripped off:<br /><br />1. There&#39;s no such thing as a digital aerial. If you get a good analogue picture now, your existing aerial should be fine for digital. It may need replacing if it&#39;s in poor condition. If you need a new aerial and you qualify for the Switchover Help Scheme, you can get one at no extra cost.<br />2. Use the test card at Ceefax p284 for guidance on whether you need a new aerial. If so, look for a Registered Digital Installer, or else a member of the trade body the CAI. Failing that, ask family and friends to recommend installers with a good track record, and get written quotations for the work from at least two.<br />3. Don&#39;t purchase goods or services from anyone who calls at your home without an appointment, or invite them into your home. Any suspicious callers should be reported to the police or trading standards. The Switchover Help Scheme always writes to its customers to confirm appointments.<br />4. Before work starts, agree the price, payment arrangements and start/finish dates. Don&#39;t pay up front.<br />5. If you suspect you have been ripped off, or that there is a rogue trader in your area, call Consumer Direct on 08454 04 05 06. <br /><br />Deborah Bain, Digital UK&#39;s Regional Manager in London, said: &#34;We&#39;re determined to do all we can to protect consumers across Kensington and Chelsea in the lead up to the switchover.

The figures for the Tri-borough partners were Kensington and Chelsea 73 per cent, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham 71 per cent and Westminster 62 per cent.  The Tri-borough average was 67 per cent.<br /><br />Other education targets include an increase in children getting places in local secondary schools and more pupils with special educational needs being taught locally.  <br /><br />There are also ambitions to create more good school places.  In Kensington and Chelsea for example, the Council will submit a planning application in 2012 to build a new academy in North Kensington. <br /><br />The mandate also sets demanding standards for services to vulnerable children and young people.  For example, the Tri-borough partners intend for children&#39;s services overall to be consistently judged as outstanding and for every children&#39;s home to be judged as good or outstanding by inspectors.<br /><br />One element of the new department&#39;s strategy for achieving the overall outstanding rating is for the adoption and fostering team to expand its own pool of local carers.  The move will reduce the councils&#39; reliance on agency fostering placements whose carers are typically more expensive and tend to live outside London, which in turn means that children cannot easily maintain contact with their friends and birth families. <br /><br />The new Fostering and Adoption team will be in place by April 2012 and is expected to deliver over £200,000 in salary savings across the three councils in its first year. In addition, the reduction in the use of external agencies for fostering placements is estimated to result in projected savings of £690,000 over three years.<br /><br />&#34;Families and Children&#39;s Services in the Royal Borough have been consistently rated as excellent and we want to keep them that way.&#34; said Royal Borough Leader, Cllr Sir  Merrick Cockell. &#34;But grants are shrinking and money is tight.  However, by sharing senior management we can reduce our costs, get the best value for our money and maintain the high standards of services for families in the borough.&#34;  <br /><br />The new combined Family and Children&#39;s department is a key part of the three councils&#39; strategy for responding to dramatic changes in local government finance created by the national financial crisis.  All three councils face reductions in government grants of approximately 26 per cent between 2011 and 2015.  By combining services, the boroughs have been able to focus spending reductions on management and back office costs and thereby ensure relative protection for frontline services.  Similar combined departments are also being created in other areas such as libraries and adult social care with a view to delivering a minimum saving of £10 million per council per year by 2014/15. <br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL"," mandate","children&#39;s services ",,,,"A unique department created to deliver children&#39;s services across three west London boroughs will this week (Thursday 5 January 2012) receive its first &#34;annual&#34; mandate from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, one the councils it serves.","New beginning for children&#39;s services in west London"

Amidst the excitement, however, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is urging residents and businesses to make sure they are prepared for the impact hosting the world&#39;s largest sporting event will have on day-to-day living in London.  <br /><br />Kensington and Chelsea will see lots of Olympic action including the torch relay, the volleyball competition at Earls Court, part of the cycle road race route and its own cultural festival on Exhibition Road.<br /><br />These events, and others taking place in Hyde Park in nearby Westminster, will mean road closures, traffic diversions, parking restrictions and changes to local public transport.<br /><br />Councillor Warwick Lightfoot, the Council&#39;s Lead Member for 2012, said:  &#34;It is very important that people who live and work in the borough are aware of the key dates and plan for the disruption that will occur.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I would urge them to check out the information on key websites such as TfL and London 2012 as well as the borough&#39;s own website.  While it is clear that the Games will be a magnificent sporting and cultural occasion the sheer scale of the event means that for a few weeks we will all need to plan ahead to minimise disruption to our daily lives and business.&#34;<br /><br />The volleyball tournament at Earls Court will take place between Saturday 28 July and Sunday 12 August and 12,000 spectators are expected to attend each session, with three sessions a day for most of the fortnight.<br /><br />The men&#39;s and women&#39;s road cycle races will come through Knightsbridge, Brompton Road and Fulham Road on Saturday 28 and Sunday 29 July. This will mean roads in the borough and other parts of west London and out to Surrey, will be closed. While the event is free to view and will attract thousands of spectators along its route, traffic and bus routes will be affected.<br /><br />During the Games, a fast-track road network called the Olympic and Paralympic Route Networks (ORN/PRN), will be created so that athletes, officials, media and others working at the Games can get to events on time. <br /><br />TfL is responsible for ensuring this network operates effectively during the Games  with the minimum of disruption for those who live and work in the capital. <br /><br />The A4 from Earl&#39;s Court Road to Hyde Park Corner is part of this route and will link Heathrow to the Olympic Park and other competition venues in east London. <br /><br />General traffic will still be able to use this part of the ORN and residents and businesses will still have access to their properties. However, to keep traffic moving on the route, TfL will make some temporary changes to the way roads in the area can be used.<br /><br />The latest information on preparing for the Games and how to get around London while they are on can be found on the following websites.<br /><br /><br /><br />Travel advice for business - http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/business-network/travel-advice-for-business/<br /><br />Getting to the Games - http://www.london2012.com/getting-to-the-games<br /><br />TfL Travel advice - http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/london2012/21787.aspx<br /><br />Olympic Road Network - http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18196.aspx<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","olympic games ","prepare ","cllr lightfoot ",,,"With just 200 days to go before the Olympic Games begin, expectation is building for what promises to be a magnificent sporting summer in the capital.

However, he chose to ignore this warning and returned to breaking the law with yet another counterfeit blue badge. <br /><br />Undercover surveillance in January 2010 by Council officers found that Mr Dahesh was displaying a counterfeit badge to avoid having to pay for parking. When approached, Mr Dahesh immediately handed the badge over stating &#34;it&#39;s not real&#34;, but then ignored the officer&#39;s questions and quickly drove off. The badge was put together using several other badges and pictures, and enabled Mr Dahesh to escape detection for months.<br /><br />New disabled badges have been issued from the beginning of this year and have state of the art anti-fraud measures to prevent fraudsters from being able to copy them without detection. They have similar security features to driving licences and a new database will allow enforcement officers to detect lost or stolen and counterfeit disabled badges in seconds. <br /><br />Disabled badges and bays are set aside for genuinely disabled people who are unable, or find it extremely difficult, to walk short distances.

Visual and tactile lines distinguish pedestrian areas from those used by vehicles. Cars are slowed by a 20mph speed limit. <br /><br />A stunning chequered granite design runs from South Kensington Station to Hyde Park along the full width of the road from building to building. Kerbs, barriers and street clutter have been removed improving access, particularly for those using wheelchairs, push chairs and motorised buggies. Pedestrians can now walk from South Kensington Station to Hyde Park along a newly created public space. <br /><br />Black cast iron drainage channel covers run along each side of Exhibition Road, about four metres out from the respective building lines. Beside the drainage channels, strips of `corduroy&#39; tactile warn blind and partially sighted people that they are moving into or out of vehicle free areas.<br /><br />Tall, sleek street lighting masts have been designed to complement the grand buildings of Exhibition Road.<br /><br />The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: &#34;Like the many other improvements we are making to London&#39;s great outdoors it is projects like these that are not just creating fantastic new places to enjoy but which are supporting and delivering many jobs across the capital.<br /><br />&#34;This clever approach to rearranging the streetscape at the heart of one of the most important cultural and academic corners on the planet will heighten the whole experience for visitors. In particular it will make it much easier and even more pleasurable for families visiting these unique attractions with space to wander unhindered in an area that puts people first.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;It has taken us the best part of ten years to get here but South Kensington and Exhibition Road finally have the setting they deserve.  <br /><br />&#34;For 2012 and far beyond, London now has a unique streetscape that will delight our many millions of visitors and which sets a new standard for urban design.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Daniel Moylan, Deputy Chairman of Transport for London (TfL), said: &#34;The improvements made to this cultural heartland of the Capital are exactly what the Mayor of London&#39;s Great Outdoors programme is seeking to achieve.<br /><br />&#34;The reimagining of the space has transformed Exhibition Road, improving the quality of life for people living and working in, and for those visiting, the area. In addition, the uplift in local retail has helped nearby business and dramatically improved the pedestrian experience.<br /><br />&#34;It is a great example of how TfL and the boroughs are contributing to transform the streets and public spaces in the Capital in advance of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.&#34;<br /><br />Leader of Westminster Council, Cllr Colin Barrow, added: &#34;The project at Exhibition Road has made a dramatic impact on the South Kensington streetscape and we are delighted to see the successful completion of these improvements. The streamlined streetscape ensures that the area is at its best for the millions of visitors each year and fits in well with our own streetscape improvements across the City of Westminster.&#34;<br /><br />Arunima Misra, Ambassador for Whizz-Kidz and a wheelchair-using Londoner, said: &#34;It&#39;s fantastic to be involved in supporting Exhibition Road to become a more accessible space. <br /><br />&#34;Disabled Londoners and tourists want to enjoy the museums and activities along this historic part of the City, just the same as non-disabled visitors. As a wheelchair-user, and Ambassador for Whizz-Kidz, I am passionate about ensuring disabled people have equal freedom of mobility to get around London. <br /><br />&#34;In the year that London hosts the Paralympic 2012 games it is all the more important we set a high standard for accessibility.&#34;","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Exhibition Road ","Mayor of London ","Shared surface ","Mayor of London ","Sir Merrick Cockell ","After three years of meticulous construction work Exhibition Road is being opened officially today (Wednesday 1 February) by the Mayor of London and the leaders of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the City of Westminster.

The four stations in areas with higher levels are all in east London.  It follows that Kensal has the highest concentration of disadvantage in the central and west London sections of the route.<br /><br />Kensal also has the highest level of unemployment in the central and west London sections and the seventh highest along the entire route.  The six stations with higher levels are all in east London.<br /><br />In addition, the study finds that the station would reduce journey times to central London by an average of 25 minutes.  That is the highest impact of any Crossrail station in central and west London.  Only three Crossrail stations would save more time and again they are all in the east. <br /><br />Business would also reap major benefits from a station.  The Kensal site is a 67 acre brownfield site.  In fact it is the seventh largest such site along the entire route and one of just two major brownfield sites in central London.<br /><br />And even though it is not a traditional town centre or high street, Kensal is in the top ten (seventh) for the retail and business floor space in its one mile hinterland.   With a turnover of £153m, Kensal is again in the top ten (ninth) of any location on the route for retail sales.<br /><br />In the conclusion to its report, Regeneris find that there is &#34;clearly scope to achieve significant lasting regeneration benefits in the hinterland of Kensal Station&#34;.  <br /><br />It goes on to say that had it been assessed at the outset of the Crossrail project Kensal &#34;...would almost certainly have been included in the top six opportunity station hinterlands&#34; identified by the London Development Agency as deserving a station on deprivation and equality grounds.<br /><br />&#34;Omitting Kensal from Crossrail would be a massive missed opportunity for London and the people of North Kensington, west Westminster and south Brent,&#34; said Sir Merrick.<br /><br />&#34;The regeneration case is compelling but so too is the transport case.  Without a Kensal station there will be a three mile gap between Old Oak and Paddington, where some of the most disadvantaged people in the capital live.  It cannot be right to bypass them when the Council itself is ready to meet the cost of the station.  It really is time to say yes to Kensal Crossrail.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Kensal","Crossrail","North kensington","Rail","Transport","Kensal in North Kensington has a stronger case for a Crossrail station than any other location outside east London, according to a new study from Regeneris, a leading firm of economic analysts.","New report strengthens case for Kensal Crossrail"

In the last year the cadets have helped with crime prevention initiatives and worked with our trading standards officers to combat underage and illegal sales of alcohol, tobacco and fireworks.<br /><br />&#34;I would particularly like to thank all the officers and staff who give their time to ensuring we have such a wonderful cadet service and hope that even more young people decide to become cadets in the future.&#34;<br /><br />Borough Commander Jason Gwillim said: &#34;It is important that we recognise the positive and valuable contribution that young people make in our communities and I would like to congratulate all of the cadets whose personal achievements have been recognised this evening.<br /><br />&#34;Tonight&#39;s ceremony, however, is not just about celebrating the personal achievements of a few and I would like to pay tribute to the effort and commitment of all our cadets and thank them for the fantastic job that they do, not only in supporting the work of my officers in the local community but also the professionalism and pride which they have displayed whenever they have been called upon to represent the Royal Borough.&#34;<br /><br />The Volunteer Police Cadet scheme provides young people in London with vocational and employment opportunities and the chance to expand their learning through a wide range of activities as well as encouraging active citizenship.

With less than six months to go to the London 2012 Games, a new advertising campaign, website and social media channels will communicate directly with the travelling public.  `Get Ahead of the Games&#39; explains how, at certain times and in certain locations - the `hotspots&#39; - London and the UK&#39;s road and rail networks will be much busier than usual.  <br /><br />But by visiting www.getaheadofthegames.com or following the @GAOTG Twitter channel, people can receive the latest tips, travel information and advice on how to plan ahead and avoid the travel hotspots.<br /><br />The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: &#34;A tremendous amount of planning has been put into ensuring that when the 2012 Games get underway the capital is able to get on with business, enjoy the festival atmosphere and make the most of this unique occasion. Businesses should be able to capitalise on the thousands of visitors and Londoners should be able to get on with their lives. This campaign is key to the preparation and planning that will help everyone in London to profit from what promises to be a remarkable summer.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Warwick Lightfoot, The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Lead Member for London 2012, said: &#34;There is no doubt that the Olympic Games are going to mean that many of us will need to make sure we plan how we get around London this summer.  I would urge residents and businesses in the borough to visit the Get Ahead of the Games website to make sure they can avoid the transport hotspots.&#34;<br /><br />LOCOG Chair Sebastian Coe said: &#34;The scale of the Games is unprecedented - across both Games there will be 14,000 athletes, 7,000 technical officials, more than 20,000 media and 11m spectators.  Our plans reflect this scale.  The Olympic Route Network is a mass transit system which allows us to manage Games traffic and get those involved where they need to be and the campaign we&#39;re talking about today will give people all the information they need to plan their journeys this summer.  Many thousands of businesses are already working to help their employees get to and from work this summer and London&#39;s residents can now do the same.

Her role as Patron of the Restorative Justice Council means she is aware just how important this work is.&#34;<br /><br />Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham councils launched their Tri-borough shared services programme in October 2010 with the aim of combining back office and management functions to protect frontline services. <br /><br />Councillor Helen Binmore, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council Cabinet Member for Children&#39;s Services says: &#34;The new Tri-borough Youth Offending Service promises a more joined-up approach to tackle youth crime and prevent young people, who were on the wrong path, from reoffending. Combining our teams into one will result in a more efficient way of reducing youth crime and antisocial behaviour in west London and it was fantastic that The Princess Royal was able to find the time to come and formally launch our new service.&#34;<br /> <br />Councillor Nickie Aiken, Westminster Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Children, Young People and Community Protection, said: &#34;Our new Tri-borough Youth Offending Service will allow us to pool expertise, share intelligence, and tackle youth crime and violence in a more effective, joined-up manner. I&#39;m thrilled that Her Royal Highness was able to view our restorative justice work first-hand.&#34;<br /><br />By combining services, the three councils will be able to protect vital frontline services during the age of austerity and lead to a 50 per cent reduction in the number of middle and senior managers.

Statistics have shown that since the trial there have been no personal injury collisions as a result of the initiative.<br /><br />After listening to cyclists&#39; views and looking at the location of London Bike Hire stations a list of potential one-way streets were drawn up.  Traffic flow, speed levels and personal injury figures were reviewed and a number of streets discounted for being too busy.<br /><br />A further eleven sections of one-way streets were given the go ahead for two-way cycling on a trial basis.  Signs will be erected over the coming months and two-way cycling implemented in these streets by the end of the year.  <br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Transport, said:<br /><br />&#34;We&#39;ve always listened to cyclists and championed helping them to move more freely around the borough.<br /><br />&#34;Since the scheme was first piloted we have closely monitored road safety statistics in the participating one-way streets.  The figures have stacked up and shown that two-way cycling poses no more of a danger to motorists, pedestrians or cyclists.  <br /><br />&#34;Our rationale for permitting two-way cycling in these streets is that it allows cyclists to avoid very busy roads and in some cases they even provide a more direct route.&#34; <br /><br />Following the success of the trial in Kensington and Chelsea the DfT has given other local authorities authorisation to use `No entry&#39; signs with `Except cycles&#39; plates.  <br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","royal borough of kensington and chelsea ","Department for Transport ","Two-way cycling ","one-way street","cllr nick paget-brown ","The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has unveiled plans to roll out its two-way cycling scheme to selected one-way streets across the borough.","Royal Borough rolls out two-way cycling scheme"

In fact Council Tax will be frozen for the third year in a row, thanks in part to a ring-fenced grant from the Government.<br /><br />Instead of increasing the tax, the Council will find £13m from a combination of further efficiencies, some increases in charges and very limited service reductions. Sharing a wide range of management and back office functions with our Tri-borough partners, Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, is expected to deliver £2.2m in savings in 2012-13 and about £10m a year by 2014-15. <br /><br />In addition there will be no inflation-related staff pay increase for a second year.  The Council is also in the process of consolidating staff into fewer buildings so that the unused capacity can be released for sale or rent.  These and other efficiencies will yield £8.6m in savings during 2012-13.<br /><br />Service sharing has enabled the Council to minimise the amount of straightforward service reductions necessary to balance the books.  In 2012-13, only £828,000 worth of direct service reductions are being made.<br /><br />Despite the financial pressures, the Council&#39;s strong reserves will enable it to continue to be ambitious for the Royal Borough. For example, the Council Cabinet has agreed to fund a new Academy and leisure centre in North Kensington.<br /><br />&#34;These are tough times in local government but full of opportunity,&#34; said Leader of the Council Sir Merrick Cockell.  &#34;An essential response to the debt crisis must be severe reductions in public spending.  As a big spender, local government is bound to play its part in that.<br /><br />&#34;Our task is to meet this challenge and do all we can to preserve the essentials of good quality services, making sure they are targeted at those most in need.  That is just what we are doing.  We are sharing services wherever that makes sense, we are making intelligent changes to services, but we are also continuing to be ambitious and in the coming year residents will see progress on a number of major projects funded by money set aside in the easier times.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Council tax ","frozen ","Leader ","Cllr cockell ",,"A budget designed to shield Royal Borough services from the full impact of the financial crisis is being put to the vote at the Council meeting on 7 March.","Kensington and Chelsea freezes Council Tax again"

We would love to see the messages from that extended to the wider UK.&#34;<br /><br />Responding to the award, Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;I am delighted that the Institute of Civil Engineers recognised the work that has been done on Exhibition Road to make South Kensington a more vibrant, welcoming area for visitors and residents alike.<br /><br />&#34;We have been planning this work for many years and I would like to thank the Council officers for their hard work and the support of TfL and the City of Westminster, without which this would not have been possible.  Finally, of course, I would also like to thank my former deputy, Daniel Moylan, for his vision and drive in starting the scheme.  The case for improving our public spaces has had no more articulate or determined advocate than Daniel Moylan. &#34;<br /><br />Among the other projects shortlisted for awards were the redevelopment of Broadcasting House, refurbishment of Blackwall Tunnel, part of the redevelopment of Kings Cross and The Shard.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Exhibition Road","cllr cockell","Leader","cllr Moylan",,"The new-look Exhibition Road was hailed as an example to follow by the Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) at its prestigious annual awards ceremony.

In fact council tax will be frozen for the third year in a row, thanks in part to a ring-fenced grant from the Government.<br /><br />Leader of the Council, Sir Merrick Cockell, said: &#34;Although we have to reduce our spending, we are doing all we can to deliver services of good, often excellent, quality, making sure they are targeted at those most in need.  Last month, 85 per cent of residents told us they were satisfied with the way the Council is working for them, up from 80 per cent in 2011. <br /><br />&#34;To maintain these high standards, we are sharing services with City of Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham wherever that makes sense. This will make a big contribution over the next four years and beyond.

The new company&#39;s first season as a private company will be the 2013 summer season.<br /><br />Both the Royal Borough and Opera Holland Park want it to become a private company and a charity because it will allow the opera to work more commercially outside of local government. The Royal Borough will continue to support the company and its summer festival with a new funding agreement that will ensure that the opera&#39;s popular accessibility schemes and cheap or free seats continue.<br /><br />Currently sponsored by Investec Wealth &#38; Investment, Opera Holland Park has grown by leaps and bounds since its first production in 1996. It now has a turnover of about £3 million and receives an annual subsidy of about £450,000 from the Royal Borough. The average season occupancy for OHP has exceeded 95 per cent since 2001.<br /><br />This new direction is supported by the Friends of Opera Holland Park, who will be closely involved in the future of the company. <br /><br />A board, lead by distinguished media lawyer, trustee of OHP Friends and supporter of OHP, Martin Kramer will oversee the company&#39;s transition to full independence He will be joined on the shadow board by Chris Cotton, John Grumbar and Colin Fletcher. <br /><br />Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, the Cabinet Member for the Arts said;<br />&#34;Our aim is to ensure the company has the brightest future possible and we will continue to work closely with it as grant funders of the company. The people running the company have everything it takes to ensure that their many supporters rally round and help turn OHP into an even greater success. <br /><br />&#34;Our commitment to the company is as strong as ever and we want it to flourish. At the same time the Council, in tough times, will have reduced the financial risk to the Council and given Opera Holland Park the freedom to determine its own destiny and to grow in new and exciting ways.&#34;<br /><br />David Colver, the Chairman of The Friends of Holland Park said:<br />&#34;The Friends of Opera Holland Park have been a major contributor to OHP for over ten years. We look forward to working with the Council in the next phase of this process; to help establish the best way forward for the company and to consolidate its position as one of London&#39;s cultural jewels. Accessibility has always been a driving principle of OHP and we are pleased to see it remaining at the core of the company&#39;s future. We intend to play a full part in supporting the company in the years to come.&#34;<br /><br />Michael Volpe. General Manager of OHP said;<br />&#34;For some years, James Clutton, OHP&#39;s Producer, and I have become ever more convinced that the company will need independence from the Council if it is  to flourish in what will be the company&#39;s `adult&#39; life.

We announced our first £1m of savings in October 2011 and are on-track to deliver the original target savings of £7.7m by 2012/13 and £33.4m by 2014/15. We are also ambitious that we will save a further £7m a year by 2015/16<br /><br /> We have protected front-line services by combining children&#39;s services, adult social care and library services across the three boroughs, and have started to share environment services across Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea councils. Nearly four in five (79 per cent) of tri-borough residents are now satisfied with the way their council is running the area, up from 77 per cent from the start of 2011<br /><br /> We have shown how honest comparison across three sovereign authorities can help identify new and better ways of working and increasing pace across our three organisations.<br /><br />Commenting on the latest tri-borough achievements, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:<br />&#34;This report shows how councils can make sensible savings through sharing back office services, joining forces to procure and cutting down on middle management whilst protecting frontline services.<br /><br />&#34;The success of the tri-borough programme is testament to the innovation and forward thinking of Westminster, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea.&#34;<br /><br />Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Leader Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell said: &#34;The decisions we took to share services have resulted in significant savings which is good news for our residents.  What is also good news is that we have identified new ways of working that mean we should be able to improve the quality of some of the services that we are providing our residents.&#34;<br />      <br />Westminster City Council Leader-elect Cllr Philippa Roe said: &#34;The tri-borough programme is already providing significant savings by allowing us to reduce management and back-office costs. The fact we have now scaled up our savings target to an ambitious £40m a year by 2015/16 illustrates just how much potential there is within this programme to respond to tough budget challenges while helping us protect, and in many cases improve, the frontline services we offer to our residents.&#34;<br /><br />Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council Leader Stephen Greenhalgh said: &#34;We have reduced management costs by 38 per cent including sharing a chief executive. Through shared contract arrangements, we are driving down the price of the services we buy. These back-office savings mean we have been able to cut council tax in Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and our partner boroughs are freezing theirs, all without the service cuts seen elsewhere.

At this time, his attendance record was so poor that he had little chance of completing any GCSEs.<br /><br />&#34;I hated school so I tried to avoid going as much as possible,&#34; explains Kieran. &#34;I was embarrassed about my reading and writing skills so I avoided going to lessons and my confidence was extremely low.&#34;<br /><br />However, as part of the xl club, Kieran received one-to-one support to help boost his skills and self-esteem from the staff at Golborne Youth Centre. As his confidence improved, he started to take part in group activities and was even able to help with scriptwriting when the group produced a short film. <br /><br />&#34;The xl club really helped me to improve my reading and writing and feel more confident in my abilities. It also helped me find out what I was good at and what I wanted to do with my life.&#34;<br /><br />Kieran&#39;s attendance record improved dramatically and, by the end of the course, he completed The Prince&#39;s Trust Level 1 qualification - the first qualification he had ever received.<br /><br />Today, Kieran is studying at college and feeling optimistic about his future. He is taking part in a painting and decorating course at Kensington and Chelsea College and hopes to find a job after the course. <br /><br />Kieran says: &#34;I don&#39;t think I would have stayed on in education if it wasn&#39;t for The Prince&#39;s Trust and Golborne Youth Centre, and I know that the skills I gained on the course will really help me to get a job in the future.&#34;<br /><br />Tanesia, 15, told the minister how The Prince&#39;s Trust xl club had helped boost her skills and confidence and improve her performance at school.<br /><br />&#34;Before I joined the xl club, I had very low self-esteem and was bullied a lot,&#34; explains Tanesia. &#34;I didn&#39;t get on with other people in my class and was struggling in most of my subjects.&#34;<br /><br />However, as part of the course, Tanesia got the one-to-one support she needed to focus on her education. She also took part in team-building activities and trips outside of school which helped her develop her interpersonal skills and improve her relationships with other pupils.<br /><br />&#34;Thanks to The Prince&#39;s Trust xl club and the youth workers at Golborne Youth Centre, I feel much more confident about my future. I&#39;m working hard towards my GCSEs and plan to go to college in September,&#34; says Tanesia. <br /><br />Children&#39;s Minister Tim Loughton MP said: &#34;As Charlie Taylor, the Government&#39;s behaviour adviser, said this week, we need to help schools tackle these issues early on, and ensure that where pupils have to be excluded, they get the right support and education to get back on track.<br /> <br />&#34;It&#39;s fantastic to see The Prince&#39;s Trust xl programme helping young people re-engage with learning to develop a sense of achievement from which they can regain momentum in mainstream education or training.&#34;<br /><br />The Prince&#39;s Trust xl club is run as part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s School Engagement Programme (SEP) which helps young people who are struggling at school to re-engage with education. The effectiveness of the programme is due to the efforts of the Council&#39;s youth workers. They engage with the young people and help them develop positive skills and attitudes so they can make the most of every opportunity offered on the Alternative Education Programme.<br /><br />As well as working with The Prince&#39;s Trust, the Council works with partners such as Kensington and Chelsea College to offer vocational training opportunities in subjects like childcare, multi-skills with construction, painting and decorating, graphic design and hair and beauty.<br /><br />So far the SEP has achieved notable success, with all year 11 learners taking part in post-16 placements on college courses or training and employment. Across the UK, 88 per cent of young people taking part in The Prince&#39;s Trust xl programme go on to work, education or training. <br /><br />Cllr Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;For many reasons some pupils struggle to engage fully at school.  These young people need specialist support in a setting away from their schools which is just what our School Engagement Programme provides.  <br /><br /> &#34;With the support of partners like the Prince&#39;s Trust and its excellent xl programme we make sure these children do not slip through the net and in most cases we are able to help them complete a study programme and find work placements.&#34;<br /><br />The Prince&#39;s Trust helps change young lives. It gives practical and financial support, developing key workplace skills such as confidence and motivation. It works with 13 to 30-year-olds who have struggled at school, have been in care, are long-term unemployed or have been in trouble with the law. Last year, more than three in four young people supported by The Trust moved into work, education or training.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Tim Loughton MP","cllr Elizabeth Campbell","Golborne Youth Centre","the Prince&#39;s Trust",,"Children&#39;s Minister Tim Loughton MP today (Monday 12 March) visited young people from Kensington and Chelsea who have struggled at school and are turning their lives around.

It was also an opportunity for some to demonstrate their artistic skills by exhibiting their art work or performing. <br /> <br />Jonathan Franco, the borough&#39;s first Gold Award winner, who attended the celebration, said: &#34;Completing my Gold Award has been a very big experience for me because I have learnt to become much more independent as a filmmaker. For me it&#39;s recognition of all my achievements and it makes me feel so proud of myself.&#34;<br /> <br />The Arts Award encourages young people to develop their talents in a wide range of creative arts across many settings.  In recent years this has included projects in drama, visual arts, dance, singing, filmmaking and script writing.<br /> <br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;It is very clear that we have some incredibly creative young people who have been able to use the Arts Award to develop their artistic skills.<br /> <br />&#34;I would like to thank all the staff who have worked so hard to make this such a success story for the borough and would encourage young people to find out more about the award and how they can get involved.&#34;<br /> <br />To find out more about the Arts Award go to www.artsaward.org.uk<br /> <br />For information on how to get involved in the Arts Award in Kensington and Chelsea email jane.o&#39;sullivan@rbkc.gov.uk or call the Achievement Team on 020 7352 3931<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","   arts Award","cllr campbell",,,,"The creative talents of young people in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea were celebrated last night (Wednesday 14 March) at the borough&#39;s Arts Award winners event in the Mayor&#39;s Parlour.","Young Arts Award winners celebrated"

Some hotels were also using LOCOG&#39;s logos and wording that may make people think they are associated in some way with the London 2012 Games when they are not.  These logos and such wording have since been removed. <br /> <br />Trading Standards is also warning consumers to watch out for fake accommodation websites that have recently sprung up. These websites often use accommodation that does not exist and once money has been taken the website will go offline and money will be lost. If accommodation looks too cheap to be true then treat it with suspicion and contact Trading Standards for advice.<br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &#34;We want to make sure that people who book hotel accommodation in Earl&#39;s Court get what they pay for and that means hotels must describe their rooms and facilities accurately.<br /><br />&#34;Our inspections show that sadly not all hotels are doing this. Our officers have also found good budget hotels in Earl&#39;s Court that have accurate websites and their standard of facilities and customer service is very good indeed, so we are certainly not trying to tar everyone with the same brush. Where we find that the descriptions do not match the reality we will take what steps we can to make sure that this is addressed by the hotel owner and, with the agreement of LOCOG, we are directing hotel owners to the `London 2012 Brand Protection Guidelines for the Tourism Sector&#39; so they understand how they can advertise their hotels in light of the London 2012 Games without infringing the rights of LOCOG.&#34;<br /> <br />If you have any concerns about a hotel in Kensington and Chelsea contact trading.standards@rbkc.gov.uk or call 020 7361 3002<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cllr Buxton","Trading Standards","Hotels","olympics",,"Hoteliers in Earl&#39;s Court are being reminded by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Trading Standards officers to make sure they describe their accommodation and facilities accurately on websites, especially in the run up to this summer&#39;s London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.","Hotels all above board?"

Earlier this month the Institute of Civil Engineers named it the winner of its Community Award category, which recognises projects that improve public space and enhance the living and working environment for the local community. <br /><br />In clinching another prestigious award for Exhibition Road, the Royal Borough saw off competition from seven other short listed local authorities. The London Transport Awards are in their ninth year and are organised by the Transport Times.<br /><br />Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, said: &#34;It gives me great pleasure to hear that Exhibition Road has been recognised as an excellent public realm at the London Transport Awards.<br />  <br />&#34;The project to transform the area was a lengthy one, but by thinking imaginatively about how the space could be used we have not only transformed the road but improved the quality of life for people living and working nearby and will offer the millions of visitors expected this year a welcoming and enjoyable experience.&#34;<br /><br />The Royal Borough&#39;s former director of Transportation and Highways, Graeme Swinburne, was honoured at the ceremony receiving an award for `Lifetime Contribution to Transport in London&#39;.<br /><br />Mr Swinburne worked for the Council for 16 years.

But after that Capital and Counties (CapCo), the owners of both Earls Court 1 and 2 and other land in the area are intent on redevelopment.  At the same time, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham is looking at the regeneration of the adjoining West Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates. And similarly Transport for London is looking at options for its Lillie Bridge rail depot. Together these three holdings make Earl&#39;s Court a site of immense potential. <br /><br />The SPD makes sure that the redevelopment of the site is coherent and delivers benefits for local people and for London as a whole, while protecting the residential amenity of existing residents.   It sets out expectations for developers seeking planning permission on key issues such as affordable housing, transport capacity, open space, community facilities, the creation of a new cultural destination and the size, location, design and layout of any new buildings, public spaces and streets.  <br /><br />It seeks to improve connections between the two boroughs, which are currently divided by rail lines and the exhibition centres. The SPD contains a series of requirements to reduce the impact of building work on local residents. <br /><br />The current planning application is now undergoing further public consultation and any future planning applications for the area will be judged against the SPD.  <br /><br />&#34;This is one of the most important development opportunities we have ever faced as a Council,&#34; said Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.  &#34;We are determined to get it right, for local people, and for London as a whole. That&#39;s what this SPD is all about.&#34;<br /><br />The adoption of the SPD follows three separate consultations that took place between October 2010 and December 2011. The final draft of the SPD was consulted on between November and December 2011, drawing 335 written responses raising over 3,500 comments. At each stage of consultation, the comments raised have been considered and where appropriate used to inform the SPD.

It is the borough&#39;s second biggest kitchen garden and provides facilities for nearly 100 green fingered residents. <br /><br />To celebrate the opening plot holders are invited to come along and get some free gardening advice and take part in some communal planting.  <br /><br />Russell Road garden is on land owned by Family Mosaic Housing Association.  The other gardens are on sites owned by Catalyst Housing Associations, L&#38;Q Housing have also worked in partnership with Family Mosaic and the Council to deliver the scheme.<br /><br />The project is part of the Royal Borough Environment Project, the Housing Regeneration Programme and Decent Neighbourhoods initiative which aim to improve the environment and make social housing cleaner, greener and safer.<br /><br />The Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for the Environment and Deputy Leader, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, said: &#34;I am delighted that we now have over 500 residents able to grow their own vegetables in these kitchen gardens.  Outside of the City of London we are the smallest and most densely populated borough in the country but by putting underused land to good use we are now able to introduce people to the relaxing and healthy hobby of gardening.<br /><br />&#34;In addition, the gardens promote a great sense of community and provide an opportunity for people to get to know one another.&#34;<br /><br />Since 2009 the Royal Borough has transformed 30 derelict sites, including one disused tennis court, into thriving gardens.<br /><br />Prior to the launch of the initiative, the Council had no allotments, but now thanks to the scheme the borough has more than 300 kitchen gardens tended by over 500 residents. <br /><br />Most of the sites were provided to the Council for free. Surveys have shown that 97 per cent of residents say the scheme has improved their environment, while 71 per cent of garden holders say it has improved their quality of life.<br /><br />Plots are allocated on a first-come first-served basis and the only criterion for plot holders is that they are resident in the ward. <br /><br />Each garden features planters which vary in size, but the average plot is approximately 1.5m x 2m, allowing residents to grow a variety of different produce but keeping the plots a manageable size. <br /><br />Plot owners are encouraged to grow a wide variety of vegetables and fruit, such as daily basics like potatoes, tomatoes, onions to more exotic produce like chillies, peppers, and pumpkins. <br /> <br />The Council has two new community gardeners Will Gould and Lisa Wilkinson who are available to provide free gardening support and advice to all plot holders.  <br /><br />The new Environment Apprentice, Chris North, is also available to assist.

Another alternative is to stop the loss of drinking establishments including public houses (Class A4 uses) where a public house makes an important contribution to community life.  <br /><br />The Royal Borough recognises that restaurants, cafes, shops and banks also have a vital role to play and other options look at the implications of protecting these too.<br /><br />Despite the economic downturn, residential land values in Kensington and Chelsea can command huge sums of money and as such they out compete any other use.  This policy seeks to protect uses that have lower land values, but remain of high value to the community.  <br /><br />Councillor Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said:<br /><br />&#34;We have put together this document because we believe that it&#39;s important to look at ways we can protect those places which perform a vital community function.  We&#39;ve lost a lot of pubs over the years and want to do what we can to make sure that the tradition of a pint and a chat in the local pub doesn&#39;t vanish because of our high residential land values.<br /><br />&#34;We fear than without any intervention the risk is that the Royal Borough could become a homogenised high quality residential area.&#34;<br /><br />The consultation is open until Tuesday 24 April.

The walk will be followed by a talk at Chelsea Library.<br /><br />Peter Clark&#39;s latest book, Dickens&#39;s London, contains five walks around modern-day London, with information about Charles Dickens&#39;s life, times, and literature at every point. These five walks also serve to interweave today&#39;s London with the city during Dickens&#39; lifetime, and overlay his experiences onto our current situation. The book is highly evocative of the author&#39;s times and attitudes to the areas in which he lived, worked and based his novels.<br /><br />Later in the week (Thursday 19 April) Dickens&#39; great great great granddaughter Lucinda Hawksley will talk about her latest book `Charles Dickens&#39; at the Kensington Central Library.  <br /><br />While many people know about Dickens the novelist, far fewer know about Dickens the man. Lucinda will talk about the lesser-known aspects of Charles Dickens&#39; life including what he was like as a husband and father, his talent for acting, his desire to be a detective and his love of travelling. She will also talk about his social conscience, the changes he made in his society and why he still remains relevant today.

In particular, this `pact&#39; will try to achieve the target set out in the recent Family Justice Review for children to have their need for a permanent plan resolved by the court within six months.<br /><br />The pilot was launched on Tuesday 24 April from 5pm to 7pm at the Law Society, 113 Chancery Lane, WC2A 1PL. <br /><br />Councils agree to deliver their assessments promptly and to a set standard, and in return judges will place the child&#39;s timescales at the heart of their decision making.<br /><br />The agreement involves the Inner London Family Proceedings Court (ILFPC), the Principal Registry, CAFCASS  and the three councils, and will encompass all care proceedings in respect of children who have suffered significant harm.<br /><br />There will be specially designated days at the ILFPC for Tri-borough cases being heard under the pilot, and, wherever possible, the same judge will be used throughout a case to ensure continuity and further speed up proceedings.<br /><br />The pilot also involves the recruitment of a new project manager and a new case manager, who will co-ordinate approximately 100 care cases across the three boroughs each year. It will be their job to track and chase the progress of each case and ensure the six month deadline is achieved.<br /><br />Case reviews will be conducted after each case is concluded, to incorporate lessons from each case into future best practice and continue improving the system.<br /><br />The new focus on speeding up care proceedings follows a clear correlation between the age of children in the care system and their success in finding a permanent family.<br /><br />Tri-borough head of children&#39;s services Andrew Christie, who oversees the children&#39;s departments in all three boroughs, said: &#34;While the measurable focus of this pilot might be to speed up family court proceedings and hit the six month target, the overarching aim is to achieve greater permanency and emotional stability for vulnerable children in our care.<br /><br />&#34;Every child needs a stable home and strong family base, so we hope this new programme will transcend targets and checklists and make a real difference to these young children&#39;s lives.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea a"," Care Proceedings Pilot"," speed up the family court process.","Tri-borough head of children&#39;s services Andrew",,"The three Tri-borough London councils of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster are set to shine the spotlight on children&#39;s care proceedings in a groundbreaking national pilot to speed up the family court process.","Councils pilot to speed up family court proceedings "

The ability to read is a life changing skill and libraries play a key role in helping children and adults develop this skill and keep it alive. Our libraries are well used and valued.

Through our tri-borough partnership our three councils are managing to save money and keep all of our libraries open - which is good news for our local readers. Residents will also soon be able to access books at all three boroughs&#39; libraries, expanding their choice to more than 1 million books.&#34;<br /> <br />Cllr Greg Smith, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council&#39;s cabinet member for residents&#39; services, said:<br />&#34;These World Book Night celebrations will shine a light on the fact that by thinking innovatively we have been able to increase choice and improve library services while making large cash savings.<br />                                                                              <br />&#34;I am particularly pleased that the bus will be visiting Hammersmith Library as the council will soon be spending more than £1.5million improving that particular branch.&#34;<br /> <br />Julia Kingsford, CEO of World Book Night, said:<br /> <br />&#34;Libraries are an incredibly important part of World Book Night and, crucially, an incredibly important part of communities and we&#39;re thrilled to be working with the tri-borough partnership to celebrate their initiative alongside World Book Night.<br /> <br />&#34;World Book Night is all about taking books to people who don&#39;t regularly read and what better way to get books out into communities in London than on a much loved icon.&#34;<br /> <br />Library events have been coordinated around the country by The Reading Agency, a founding partner of World Book Night, who specialise in spreading reading through libraries.

Unfortunately, it has one of the highest records of collisions between pedestrians and vehicles in the borough. <br /><br />As a result of this, the decision has been taken by the Council to prohibit vehicles (except disabled badge holders) between the junctions of Westbourne Grove and Lancaster Road, from 10am to 4pm on Saturdays, in a trial that could run for up to 18 months.<br /><br />Traffic will still be able to cross Portobello Road at its junctions with Westbourne Grove, Elgin Crescent, Blenheim Crescent, Westbourne Park Road and Lancaster Road during the times when Portobello Road is closed. <br /><br />The decision to close this part of the road follows a consultation in September 2011 with residents, market traders and local businesses in which 82 per cent agreed with the proposal.  In addition, visitors to the market listed motor traffic as a negative feature in a survey in 2010.<br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;The volume of people who come to Portobello Market is testament to its ongoing popularity.

Parks in both boroughs have also been awarded the Mayor of London&#39;s prestigious safer parks award.<br /><br />From April 2013, the two teams will unite to provide a single uniformed enforcement service covering the parks, cemeteries and open spaces in both Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea residents are being asked what issues they want the Parks Police to prioritise.<br /><br />Traditionally parks constables have performed a large number of duties to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour in parks and open spaces. These include issuing fixed penalty notices for littering and dog fouling, enforcing dispersal zones and the controlled drinking zone and supporting the Met with drug operations. They also perform more routine duties including locking and unlocking parks, dealing with fly-tipping and graffiti in the parks as well as providing security at major annual events, such as the fireworks displays and the boat race.<br /><br />Cllr Nick Paget Brown, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for the Environment said. &#34;The presence of a Parks Police service is vital to ensuring that all residents can enjoy our parks in peace and to reduce incidents of antisocial behaviour. We want to make sure we are directing our resources at the issues that matter most to residents so I hope they will take time to complete this short survey and let us know what issues they would like the Parks Police to prioritise.&#34;<br /><br />The parks police are empowered to detain offenders for crimes within parks and open spaces and enforce byelaws and dog control orders. The team also provides lost property and truancy patrol services as well as recovering all manner of paraphernalia including hypodermic needles and stolen bikes.<br /><br />Cllr Greg Smith, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council cabinet member for Environment, Leisure and Residents Services, said: &#34;By combining the best of the two parks constabulary services into one elite team we will be able to provide a more responsive service at a reduced cost to taxpayers.

Developed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in partnership with local authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the FHRS provides information on food hygiene standards to help people choose where to eat out or shop for food. <br /><br />Food outlets such as restaurants, takeaways and pubs, are inspected by the Council&#39;s Environmental Health Officers to check that their hygiene standards meet legal requirements. The hygiene standards found at these inspections will now be rated on a scale ranging from 0 at the bottom (which means `urgent improvement necessary&#39;) to a top rating of 5 (`very good&#39;). <br /><br />These ratings will be available for anyone to view on the FSA website at food.gov.uk/ratings and the food business will be given a sticker and certificate and encouraged to display these at the entrance to their premises.  This is so that their customers can easily see the rating and decide if they want to go in.<br /><br />Around one million people suffer from food poisoning every year, and the FSA&#39;s aim in developing the FHRS is to reduce this number. The ratings will give consumers a glimpse of what is going on in the kitchen when they eat out, or behind the scenes at the places they shop, before they make their decision about which place they prefer to visit.<br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &#34;This is a clear and easily understood rating scheme which means consumers can make informed choices about where they shop for food or which restaurants they eat at.  It is based on the findings of inspections by the Council&#39;s Environmental Health Officers who often visit premises completely unannounced to get a proper view of just what is going on behind the scenes.&#34;<br /><br />Catriona Stewart, Head of the Food Hygiene Ratings Team at the FSA, said: &#34;We recognise the real progress that has been made in improving hygiene standards in food outlets through local food hygiene rating schemes.

From building security and maintenance to printing and cleaning there could be opportunities for local firms to benefit from the new contracts.<br /> <br />The open day provided an opportunity for the five shortlisted bidders and local businesses to meet and assess each other&#39;s capacities and requirements.<br /> <br />Councillor Timothy Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Housing, said: &#34;Our new Tri-borough arrangements will naturally create some very large new contracts, worth a lot of money.  We have made it clear to all the bidders that we would like to see them make use of local smaller and medium sized firms when it comes to delivering these important services.<br /> <br />&#34;I hope that the open day proved useful and look forward to many locally-based businesses benefiting from sub-contracts in the future.&#34;<br /> <br />Councillor Harry Phibbs, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Engagement, said: &#34;During these tough economic times, it is hugely important that we do all that we can to support our local small and medium-sized businesses. At Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, we have made it easier for these businesses to bid for council work by stripping away a lot of the bureaucracy and removing the hoops that they need to jump through. I hope those changes will soon be adopted on a Tri-borough scale.&#34;<br /> <br />Westminster City Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Finance and Customer Services, Councillor Melvyn Caplan, said: &#34;The success of this open day proves that the cost-saving potential of our three councils&#39; shared services programme does not stop at simply reducing back office managers. It also gives us strong collective bargaining power to drive down costs of external contracts and services, thereby saving our council taxpayers even more money.&#34;<br /> <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Tri-borough","cllr coleridge","bidders","contracts",,"More than 130 delegates from 60 small and medium-sized businesses packed out Kensington Town Hall on Monday 30 April at an open day to explore the business opportunities being created by a transformation in the way three west London councils run their town halls and other facilities.","Local firms look for Council contracts"

And he is only the second Councillor to be elected for a second term as Mayor, the other being the late Councillor Miss Elizabeth M Christmas MBE.<br /><br />Following his election Cllr Buckmaster said: &#34;It is a very great honour to have been elected as Mayor for a second time and particularly in this Diamond Jubilee and Olympic Year. I am very much looking forward to building on the experience of my first mayoralty and to representing the Royal Borough.&#34;<br /><br />Born in Liverpool in October 1938, Christopher Buckmaster read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford, where he was Chairman of the University Conservative Association.  He subsequently went into business and travelled widely. He has lived and worked in the Caribbean, North America, Australia and New Zealand and also in Africa.<br /><br />For three years he was a member of the London Regional Board of the Confederation of British Industry. He has always taken an interest in voluntary organisations having served on the management committees of a number of them, including Open Age.  He was Chairman of the Trustees of Kensington and Chelsea People First, an organisation seeking to develop self-advocacy amongst adults with learning difficulties.<br /><br />He was elected to the Council in May 1994 and represents Campden Ward. At various times he has served on social services, housing and education committees, as well as being a director of the Tenant Management Organisation.

They can also expect new individual combi- boilers to replace the out of date communal heating system.<br /><br />Grenfell Tower itself is to have new external cladding to provide an effective rain screen and again improve thermal efficiency.  The cladding will also dramatically improve the appearance of the Tower in a way that complements the new Academy and leisure centre being planned on the adjacent site.<br /><br />And in the spirit of the Elm Park Gardens project, currently unused space on the lower floors of Grenfell will be converted to make between four and six new affordable homes.  In fact the Cabinet were so impressed with the success of the Elm Park development, they authorised the allocation of a further £700,000 from the proceeds for the identification and development of other &#34;hidden homes,&#34; at Holmefield House, Greaves Tower and elsewhere.<br /><br /> &#34;We have created 36 brand new homes out of dead space and the proceeds from that will now fund badly needed work elsewhere,&#34; said Cabinet Member for Housing and Property, Cllr Tim Coleridge.<br /><br />&#34;So the Elm Park Gardens project really has been something of a triumph; the challenge now is to see if we can repeat the hidden homes formula elsewhere.&#34; <br /><br />The basement developments, at Elm Park Gardens in the heart of Chelsea, have provided 36 high quality new homes, 23 for sale and 13 for affordable rent.<br /><br />After not faring well in the war years the Gardens were compulsorily purchased by Chelsea Borough Council in 1949.  Records show that by then the basements were already vacant.  Over time they came to house communal heating systems, ducting, electricity units and much else besides.  In parts, they were also used by tenants for storage purposes.<br /><br />Elm Park Gardens is a late Victorian Square, with some post war additions.

The public will be able to give their views on the planning brief up until Friday 8 June.<br /><br />Construction of the Westway Flyover was completed in 1970. The development was controversial leading to the demolition of many properties and the severance of a number of roads. Despite the passage of time, the scars of this development have still not completely healed and it is hoped that this document help create a better environment improving links between communities to the north and the south of the flyover.<br /><br />Consultation on the future of the 23-acre site established a number of key principles including:<br /><br /> An ongoing requirement to provide office space and facilities for existing and new community-based charities and organisations that are focussed upon the delivery of services and support to local people<br /><br /> Providing for the particular needs and demands of young adults, including the retention or reprovision of the existing skate park facilities<br /><br /> Maintaining a trading environment for the Portobello Market, which is important to local economic vitality, and providing improved market facilities<br /><br /> Providing new and replacement accommodation capable of meeting the needs of a wide range of small-scale business users<br /><br /> Sustaining existing creative industries and providing new opportunities to cater for potential future demand<br /><br /> Consolidating and enhancing existing sports facilities<br /><br /> Improving the quality of the environment, safety and access <br /><br /> Enhancing connections, particularly to White City and to the London Borough of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham in general. <br /><br />In parallel with the previous public consultation exercise, a number of other technical studies and assessments have been undertaken in order to gain an understanding of the area and the issues it faces.<br /><br />The area supports a number of existing land uses and functions that due to their location and proximity to other uses are not fulfilling their potential. There is an opportunity to improve the long-term sustainability of the area both through the relocation of certain land uses to more appropriate locations and/or through the redevelopment of existing sites and buildings to allow for the introduction of more appropriate and complementary uses and functions. <br /><br />Councillor Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Planning, said: &#34;This is a very important document indeed and sets out just what we believe any future development of the area underneath and around the Westway should include.  I urge local residents and businesses to look at it carefully and to have their say on the future of this important area.<br /><br />&#34;I believe that in the years ahead we could see a far more accessible, inviting and indeed thriving Westway at the heart of North Kensington.&#34;<br /><br />The draft planning brief gives detailed information on specific areas and amenities including the Westway Sports Centre and Stable Way, Maxilla Walk, Malton Road, Thorpe Close and Acklam Road.<br /><br />Once the consultation period is over the planning brief will be adopted as an official Supplementary Planning Document which will provide a blueprint for potential future development of the area.<br /><br />To view the draft planning brief go to <br />www.rbkc.gov.uk/planningandconservation.aspx<br /><br /><br />A copy can be picked up from the following locations during normal office hours:<br />Town Hall: Hornton Street, London, W8 7NX (Mon to Fri: 9am to 5pm); <br />Kensington Central Library: Phillimore Walk, London, W8 7RX (Mon: 9:30am to 8pm; Tue: 9:30am to 8pm; Wed: 9:30am to 5pm; Thurs: 9:30am to 8pm; Fri: 9:30am to 5pm; Sat: 9:30am to 5pm); <br />Chelsea Library: Chelsea Old Town Hall Kings Road, London, SW3 5EZ (Mon: 9:30am to 8pm; Tue: 9:30am to 8pm; Wed: 9:30am to 5pm; Thurs: 9:30am to 8pm; Fri: 9:30am to 5pm; Sat: 9:30am to 5pm); <br />North Kensington Library: 108 Ladbroke Grove, London, W11 1PZ (Mon: 9:30am to 8pm; Tue: 9:30am to 8pm; Wed: 9:30am to 5pm; Thurs: 9:30am to 8pm; Fri: 9:30am to 5pm; Sat: 9:30am to 5pm); <br />Brompton Library: 210 Old Brompton Road, London, SW5 0BS (Mon: 9:30am to 8pm; Tue: 9:30am to 8pm; Wed: 9:30am to 5pm; Thurs: 9:30am to 8pm; Fri: 9:30am to 5pm; Sat: 9:30am to 5pm); <br />Notting Hill Gate Library: Pembridge Square, London, W2 4EW (Mon: 1pm to 8pm; Tue: 1pm to 7pm; Wed: CLOSED; Thurs: 9.30am to 1pm; Fri: 9.30am to 1pm and 2pm to 5pm; Sat: 9.30am to 1pm and 2pm to 5pm); and <br />Kensal Library: 20 Golborne Road, London, W10 5PF (Mon: 1pm to 6pm; Tue: 1pm to 6pm; Wed: Closed; Thurs: 1pm to 6pm; Fri: 9.30am to 5pm; Saturday: 9.30am to 1pm, 2pm to 5pm) <br /><br />If you wish to send your comments in writing please send them to:<br />The Executive Director, Planning and Borough Development<br />Policy Team<br />Kensington Town Hall, <br />Hornton Street,<br />London W8 7NX<br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","  westway","planning brief","cllr ahern",,,"A bright future for the area underneath and around the Westway in North Kensington, with exciting new retail and business opportunities and art, leisure and sports facilities has been outlined in a draft planning brief published by the Council.","Have your say on Westway&#39;s future"

In light of this the Council is currently consulting on a document designed to find out what residents think.<br /><br />The recently published `Basement Extensions: Issues&#39; paper looks at existing Council policies and asks whether these are effective and whether they should remain the same or be changed.<br /><br />It is difficult to be precise as to how much basement development is carried out in the borough because some cases do not require planning permission and there is no requirement for an owner to apply for a certificate of lawful proposed development. <br /><br />The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was probably the first local authority to produce a comprehensive set of planning policies to control basement development and the Council is now reviewing its policies towards basement development. This is a subject of particular concern to many residents.<br /><br />The `Basement Extensions: Issues&#39; paper is the first stage in a review process. When the consultation period closes the Council will develop a set of draft policies for public consultation in September 2012. All issues raised will be considered before finalising the policies at the end of the year.  The policies will be the subject of an independent examination which is likely to take place in March 2013. <br /><br />In Kensington and Chelsea extending homes upwards or rearwards may not always be acceptable. Extending homes downwards is, therefore, seen by some residents as a practicable option.<br /><br />Councillor Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Planning, said: &#34;Basement extensions offer people a way to improve their homes but can be controversial.  People are surprised to learn that they often do not need planning permission.<br /> <br />&#34;We have sought to create a number of planning policies to control this type of development and this latest paper gives residents a chance to learn more about the issue and to give their views on whether or not our policies need to change and, if so, how.<br /><br />&#34;I urge as many people as possible to read the consultation document and to respond to us.&#34;<br /><br />The consultation runs until Friday 8 June.  <br /><br />The paper is available to view on the Council&#39;s website www.rbkc.gov.uk/planningandconservation.aspx or at all Council libraries and in the Planning Information Office at Kensington Town Hall.  <br /><br />Email the Policy Team at planningpolicy@rbkc.gov.uk for copies of these documents or with any queries you may have.<br /><br />If you wish to send your comments in writing send them to:<br /><br />The Executive Director of Planning and Borough Development<br />Policy Team<br />The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea<br />Kensington Town Hall <br />Hornton Street<br />London W8 7NX<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","basement","Development","cllr ahern",,,"Basement extensions are becoming more common and, in some cases, controversial.

She was re-elected as a councillor for Avondale ward in 1994 and since May 2002 has represented Notting Barns ward.<br /><br />Commenting on her nomination, Councillor Blakeman said: &#34;I am very honoured to have been nominated by the Labour Group to stand in the election for Mayor of the Royal Borough.

The building will be refurbished and a play centre and space for community use will be developed on the first floor. <br /><br />Following the Cabinet decision Council officials will meet with the school staff and governors to discuss when the building work can begin. As the new classrooms will be built in an area away from the main school the work can be completed without disruption to the day-today running of the school.<br /><br />Planning permission and listed building consent are already in place as in 2009 the school considered leasing the building to a private French nursery but these plans did not proceed.

The department will also coordinate service delivery with primary care trusts and the emerging clinical commissioning groups.<br /><br />Westminster City Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Children, Young people and Community Protection, Cllr Nickie Aiken, said: &#34;Our Tri-borough programme is all about finding innovative ways to save money while actually improving services for children and young people.

The D&#38;AD annual features the most outstanding international design and advertising work from the previous 12 months.<br /><br />The exciting lift installation in the Grade II listed Park Walk Primary School building offers more than mere elevation. A lift zone was created to stimulate children&#39;s educational curiosity through an impressive display of life-size animal murals, whilst the rear face of the lift car is glazed to allow views of nocturnal animals. The results are impressive as the striking black and white pictogram-style animals inspire and educate the pupils outside of the classroom.

Nightclub operators have a duty to be responsible and to permit their neighbours to sleep at night.<br /><br />&#34;Costs of £76,825 are unique in my licensing experience.  I hope the residents, from all walks of life, whose lives have been blighted by noise and nuisance from Public will be able to enjoy the area again now. <br /><br />&#34;What is distressing is the length of time this has taken to come to court.  It is almost exactly 12 months since the original decision of the Licensing Committee and during this time Public has been allowed to continue to operate and to disturb its neighbours.  The law should be changed so that decisions of the Licensing Committee have immediate effect, subject to appeal.&#34;<br /><br />The Council&#39;s case was based on concerns raised by residents, the police, ward Councillors and the Council&#39;s own Environmental Health Officers.<br /><br />Residents were being disturbed by the noise caused by customers who were talking loudly and screaming while queuing to enter the club or on leaving the club.  They were also blocking the pavement.<br /><br />The police&#39;s concerns included the increase in drunken behaviour on the streets in the area of Public and an increase in the number of people from Public having to be treated by Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, suffering from alcohol related problems and, in some cases, even fighting in the hospital.<br /><br />The Council&#39;s Environmental Health Officers had issues with the noise that residents near to Public had to put up with late at night.  Other Council officers also had concerns over the significant number of complaints received from residents in the area around Public.<br /><br />Following a number of complaints from residents since the granting of a licence to Public, a formal request was made to review its licence in March 2011 which resulted in the Licensing Committee deciding in May 2011 to alter the licence so that Public would have to close at midnight on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, rather than 2.30am as previously.<br /><br />Public appealed on the basis that the decision of the Licensing Committee was wrong and that the noise created was caused by other licensed premises in the area.  Only shortly before the start of the hearing in December 2011 did the premises change its stance and contend that whilst there had been problems in the past   they had made a number of improvements since the hearing.  The District Judge acknowledged some improvements have been made but found that the premises was still causing a nuisance to local residents.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cllr Buckmaster","Licensing Committee","Public","nightclub ",,"The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s decision to alter the premises licence of a nightclub on Lots Road/King&#39;s Road was upheld by Hammersmith Magistrates Court yesterday, Tuesday 15 May 2012.","Public nightclub - Reduction in hours confirmed"

Food handlers had not received any training in food safety. The officer issued an immediate written warning and a hygiene improvement notice was served in relation to pest control. <br /><br />During a revisit in January 2011, the officer found that the matters from the previous inspection had not been rectified. Mouse faeces were seen on the floor under the servery counter and there were still several places where rodents could get into the shop. <br /><br />Mr Hussain attended Court and prior to pleading guilty stated that due to health problems in 2009 he had passed the business on to his cousin who had assumed day-to-day control of the shop. <br /><br />District Judge Lachhar gave Mr Hussain credit for his early guilty plea but said as the business was still in his name he was responsible for it. She also said that the matters before her were very serious and that anybody visiting the shop would have been horrified by what they saw.<br /><br />As Mr Hussain already had two previous warnings he was ordered to pay a £1,000 fine for each charge, the Council&#39;s full costs of £714.20 and £15 victim surcharge.  <br /><br />In total Mr Hussain has to pay £9,729.20 by 15 July 2012. <br /><br />A fines collection order was also imposed.<br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &#34;This butcher&#39;s shop clearly posed a threat to the health of anyone buying meat from it.

He then reapplied in June 2010 on the basis that his estranged partner had asked him to share the care of their two small children as she was struggling to cope as a result of disabilities.  But the Council again refused to house him as it could see no apparent impediment to him meeting his parental responsibilities at the children&#39;s maternal home.<br /><br />Solicitors for Mr El Goure asked for a statutory review of that decision arguing that the mother&#39;s disabilities constituted an &#34;exceptional circumstance&#34; that should qualify their client for his own council home.  However, officers maintained their original view that Mr El Goure should not be rehoused.<br /><br />There followed a series of appeals and hearings culminating in Friday&#39;s judgement by the Court of Appeal.  The key legal argument turned on whether Mr El Goure&#39;s circumstances should have been considered &#34;exceptional.&#34;   Had they been so then the Council would have been obliged to rehouse him.<br /><br /> Separately, solicitors for the father also argued that a procedural flaw in the original decision meant the Council should consider the case afresh.  Specifically they alleged that the Council failed to give correct notification to the applicant of his right to make representations on the review. However in his judgement, Lord Justice Mummery noted that the Court of Appeal hearing was the sixth time the appellant&#39;s application had been considered.  <br /><br />&#34;Given that history,&#34; he said, &#34;and the detailed representations received from his lawyers at every stage, the accusation that he has been denied a fair procedure is somewhat surprising.&#34;  <br /><br />In dismissing the appeal Lord Justice Mummery commented that the appellant had failed to establish that there was any breach of duty by the Council or any legal misdirection.  Lord Justices Moore-Bick and Black both concurred.<br /><br />Commenting on the judgement, Cllr Timothy Coleridge, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Housing, said: &#34;That the appellant wants to share the child care is of course the right thing. But the state cannot be expected to provide two family homes in order that he can do so.  <br /><br />&#34;That is not an option available for those outside the social housing system and it shouldn&#39;t be for those in it either, other than in the most rare and exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />&#34;I&#39;m delighted and relieved that the Court has agreed with us.&#34;<br /><br />This information is made available for a limited period in order to promote the openness, transparency and accountability of the criminal justice system to the people it serves.

In 2000/01 residential burglaries were at a high of 2,558.  <br /><br />One of the methods used in the Royal Borough to make it harder for the burglar is to help people secure their homes.  Advice and sometimes even grants have been made available to help make residents&#39; homes more difficult for the criminal to break into.  Target hardening, as this scheme is known, has proved popular with landlords, people living in burglary hotspots and those who have been burgled previously.<br /><br />Cllr Rock Fielding-Mellen, Cabinet Member for Civil Society, said: &#34;Burglary is an upsetting and unsettling crime, so this reduction is to be warmly welcomed. <br /> <br />&#34;I am very pleased that even in these difficult financial times we have managed to ensure that funding was found to maintain our target hardening project, which is just a part of our overall strategy of making Kensington and Chelsea as hostile to criminals as possible.<br /><br />&#34;Of course, there is no room for complacency and we will continue to work with the police and other agencies to make it as difficult as possible for anyone who thinks they can burgle the homes of our residents.&#34;<br /><br />Superintendent Alisdair Ferguson, Head of Operations at Kensington and Chelsea Police, said: &#34;We have had another good year in fighting crime. We have achieved reductions in burglary and improved performance in bringing offenders to justice. Reducing burglary will continue to be our focus and this year I aim to reduce these offences even further. <br /><br />&#34;This will be challenging, especially with the financial constraints being felt across the public sector. <br /><br />&#34;There are a number of things you can do to stop yourself becoming a victim of burglary. Now the warmer weather is upon us we all leave our windows open. Unsecured windows and unlocked doors are open invitations to burglars and opportunist criminals. Make sure you lock your doors and windows before you go out, even if for a short time, last thing at night and when you go on holiday.&#34;<br /><br />The reduction of burglaries in the borough bucks the general trend in London where a 4.9 per cent increase was reported by the police in April. <br /><br />To find out more about protecting your property from burglary and for enquiries about crime prevention grants, contact David Cunningham, Burglary Reduction Project Manager in the Community Safety Team on 020 7795 6660 or email commsafe@rbkc.gov.uk<br /><br />End<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","burglary","Councillor feilding mellen ",,,,"There was a reduction of 5.2 per cent in the number of burglaries reported to the police in 2011/12, down to a total of 980.","Reported burglaries down in the borough"

And the Council has been a keen supporter of the idea for almost as long.<br /><br /> &#34;Our Capital needs that transport capacity and our country desperately needs growth,&#34; said Leader of the Council, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell.<br /><br />&#34;Now is the time to secure both Crossrails taking every opportunity along the routes to create investment and growth.  That means a station at Portobello and one on the King&#39;s Road.&#34; <br />The route safeguarded for the Chelsea Hackney line back in 1991 includes a station on the King&#39;s Road and the Council support for the scheme is based on the need to relieve congestion in the Chelsea area and provide residents with easier access to the West End and City. <br /><br />The London First study has suggested that the route could be modified to run to Clapham Junction as well as Euston, where it could provide direct access to the new HS2 link<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Crossrail","chelsea hackney line","cuncillor cockell",,,"The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has warmly welcomed the revival of plans for the Chelsea Hackney line.","Chelsea Hackney line revival"

They found an established culture of continuous improvement and a progressive attitude, supported by a strong political commitment and desire to build quality services.<br /><br />New demands on the services were said to be met with rapid and imaginative responses and the Council was seen to be continually searching for efficient use of its resources.<br /><br />The inspectors reported that Councillors and officers continually focus on the needs of children and seek the views of families and service users.<br /><br />A survey of 19 children and young people undertaken by Ofsted as part of the inspection found that 17 reported that they felt safe or very safe (two did not respond).<br /><br />Referrals to the Council are responded to quickly and children seen promptly.  Risks were judged to be appropriately assessed in conjunction with partners.<br /><br />The views of children, their parents and carers are actively sought by Councillors and professionals as part of commissioning services and the inspectors found clear evidence that these consultations influenced and shaped services.<br /><br />Services for Looked after Children benefited from strong leadership and management across the authority.  Inspectors noted that there was a shared vision among Councillors that drives the Council, as a corporate parent, to ensure that each Looked after Child and young person has every opportunity to achieve.<br /><br />The children and young people who contributed to the inspection reported generally good levels of satisfaction with the service and a significant majority considered that being in care had improved their lives.<br /><br />The relationships between children and their social workers was highlighted with over 85 per cent of children and young people reporting that the relationship was good.  <br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;There was much for us to be encouraged about in this latest Ofsted report.

This is not the only recent project to improve the school facilities as the Royal Borough agreed to provide over £420,000 to fund two brand new classrooms for reception children with direct access to their own dedicated play area. <br /><br />The library project was helped by donations of 4,000 books from volunteer organisations, Thomas&#39;s Schools Foundation, Strawberry Fields Nursery and Junior League of London. This included one child who decided to forego birthday presents and collected one hundred books. In addition, Foyles Foundation confirmed £15,000 of funding to ensure an extensive non-fiction collection. <br /><br />Junior League of London, a long-term supporter of the school, has financed shelving in the library. Furthermore, the organisation held two one-day events with 12 volunteers to label many of the books. <br /><br />The Mayor said: &#34;I was delighted to be invited to Colville Primary School to open its exciting new library.

The big picture is that our economic and regeneration case is overwhelming.  This is exactly the sort of project our residents need, this landlocked part of north-west London needs and that our national economy needs.&#34;<br /><br />The Council has been leading a campaign to bring a station to the north of the borough for many months.  That campaign has the support of MPs, MLAs, the London Borough of Brent, housing bodies and hundreds of local businesses and residents, all of whom seem to think a station would be a tremendous benefit to one of the largest areas of deprivation in London.<br /><br />The station, which the Council recently dubbed Portobello, would enable the development of the 67-acre brown field site in which its sits.  That site would accommodate some 2,500 new homes, and create thousands of new jobs.  <br /><br />A recent report by economic analysts, Regeneris, suggested that there was a stronger case for a station on the site than at any other confirmed station site outside of east London.

"4132","08/06/2012 12:07:00","STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINING CHILDREN'S CENTRES UNVEILED","The Council has today (Friday 8 June) unveiled its strategy for keeping all eight of its children&#39;s centres open and well funded, despite sharply declining resources.<br /><br />In common with every local authority, Kensington and Chelsea is coping with unprecedented reductions in central government support.  Between 2011 and 2015 its overall grant will fall by some 26 per cent.  <br /><br />As a big spending department Children&#39;s Services is having to play its part in that.  Through Tri-borough service sharing it is already delivering significant savings.  But it must find a further £1.6m next year (2013/14) and £1.51m in 2014/15.<br /><br />The key aim of the strategy is to contribute to those savings without reducing the number of childcare places or sacrificing service quality, especially for children from disadvantaged backgrounds who often benefit most from the range of early years services provided at children&#39;s centres.   Another objective is to provide Royal Borough residents with an Early Years Service that is comparatively more generous than elsewhere in the capital.<br /><br />Currently the Royal Borough has eight children&#39;s centres, for which there is a complex set of management arrangements: some centres are managed by the Council, others are schools with boards of governors. They are organised into two locality groups, one north of Kensington High Street, the other south.<br /><br />The proposals will now nominate one children&#39;s centre in each group to take a lead role but all the other centres would play their part in delivering the full range of children&#39;s centre services across the locality, with activities spread across the week and around the centres to avoid duplication.  <br /><br />This reorganisation will simplify management and reduce management costs while protecting front line services.<br /><br />A further major benefit would be that the borough&#39;s children&#39;s centres would then be treated by Ofsted as just two inspection units rather than eight as at present.  This dramatic reduction in the inspection burden would also save money, and reduce stress.<br /><br />The vital full day childcare provided by children&#39;s centres will no longer have to be provided directly by the Council.  Kensington and Chelsea has a thriving private and voluntary sector with the proven capability to provide high quality care at lower cost than the Council can manage.  <br /><br />Under these new arrangements childcare places for disadvantaged children would be purchased by the Royal Borough rather than provided directly. But children&#39;s centres will continue to be &#34;universal&#34; and open to all the community. <br /><br />In-depth consultation will shortly get underway with staff, centre users and the wider public and final decisions will be taken only after the consultation has concluded.<br /><br />&#34;Everyone understands the economic context that our country and indeed the whole of Europe finds itself in,&#34; said Cabinet Member for Education, Cllr Elizabeth Campbell.<br /><br />&#34;We are very proud of what our Early Years Service has achieved and we are focusing hard on reducing management back office functions so that those achievements can survive these lean years.<br /><br />&#34;We don&#39;t want Royal Borough children to miss out on Early Years services, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.<br />  <br />&#34;I believe we have the right strategy for doing that, one that is even capable of delivering some improvements and we are now going out to explain it and debate it with our staff, service users and the public.&#34;   <br /><br />Children&#39;s centres are defined as places where integrated services are available to children and families to support them in meeting their full potential.  They are intended for families with young children.  As well as childcare, services may include health visitors, breastfeeding support, early learning, parenting support plus more specialist services like speech therapy, healthy eating, money management and advice on employment and training.  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Royal borough ","Cllr campbell ","children&#39;s services ","children&#39;s centres ","Savings ","The Council has today (Friday 8 June) unveiled its strategy for keeping all eight of its children&#39;s centres open and well funded, despite sharply declining resources.","Strategy for sustaining children&#39;s centres unveiled"

Fifteen-year old Sophie won gold in the Cirrus junior female race. 12-year-old Oliver narrowly missed out on gold in the boy&#39;s lightning race, finishing second, before 14-year-old Alexandra Khlaf won the silver medal in the Cirrus junior male race. <br /><br />In the kayak slalom, the borough finished third overall. Tobias Koralek-Martin won a bronze medal in the male senior slalom race before Oliver Khlaf convincingly won the male junior slalom after a best run of 84 seconds.  <br /><br />Kensington and Chelsea also had teams competing in the sailing and rowing competitions and finished a respectable seventh in both.

The two authorities now share a chief executive. Later this month the Tri-borough councils will share their learning and experiences with other local authorities at a conference at Kensington Town Hall.  <br /> <br />This financial year £7.7 million of savings will be made across the three authorities. The eventual £40 million-a-year total savings shared between the three authorities represents around 7.3 per cent of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham&#39;s total net budget expenditure.<br /> <br />Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, the Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said &#34;It is up to other councils to decide whether combining services makes sense. Many have already gone down this route. We stand ready to share our learning and experience to help others make ends meet.&#34;<br /> <br />Cllr Nicholas Botterill, the new Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, said: &#34;A year ago our plans were seen as radical, now they are seen as commonsense. Sharing costs, overheads and expertise is not only bringing down the cost of delivering services it is leading to better and more effective services.&#34;<br /> <br />Cllr Botterill pointed to the fact that library users can now borrow books in any of the three areas. The councils are also pioneering work to support 1720 troubled families. With every £1 spent on troubled families, £2.10 is saved for the taxpayer in avoided costs. The programme is helping families to turn around their lives, assisting them in repairing complex family issues while also supporting them into employment, education or training.<br /> <br />The `One year on&#39; report reveals how the plans are supporting the transfer of power locally. Employee mutuals have been launched in areas around support for schools, youth services and ICT support services.  People with longer-term care needs are being offered personal budgets, ward budgets are being extended in two of the boroughs, while Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham are piloting neighbourhood budgets in Queens Park (Westminster) and White City (Hammersmith &#38; Fulham).<br /> <br />A sovereignty guarantee signed by the three councils ensures local accountability and decision making, with each individual council responsible for their own budgets, policies and service specification. <br /> <br />Cllr Philippa Roe, Leader of Westminster City Council, said: &#34;Sharing services is not just about reducing cost, important as that is in this age of austerity, it is about improving lives and innovation.&#34; <br /> <br />The first Tri-borough joint campaign `Summer in the City&#39; offered summer activities across the three authorities. The programme is being repeated this year and will be launched at a youth engagement event taking place at Chelsea FC next Saturday (June 23) called &#34;The Big Shout&#34;.<br /> <br />Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said: &#34;The success of the Tri-borough approach is testament to the innovation and forward thinking of Westminster, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea.<br /> <br />&#34;Its councillors and officers are my London 2012 heroes for making such creative savings to protect frontline services, all while keeping council tax bills down helping families and pensioner with their cost of living. <br /> <br />&#34;No council should even contemplate cutting services before they have considered following this example of how to join forces with neighbours to share back office services, procure better, slash in-house management and cut overhead costs.

There will also be a `come and try&#39; sports day for everyone on Holland Park&#39;s sports field.<br /><br />The torch will then leave the borough again for Hammersmith and Fulham before returning for its final leg along Notting Hill Gate before heading into Westminster.<br /><br />The Royal Borough invites all our residents to welcome the torch and cheer on our local torchbearers as they carry the flame on its journey to the Olympic Park.<br /><br />There will be some disruption to traffic in the Royal Borough on the day, but the Council is working closely with LOCOG and TfL to minimise the disruption and help residents and businesses plan their day around it. <br /><br />Councillor Warwick Lightfoot, Member Lead for 2012, said: &#34;Having the Olympic torch relay will be very exciting and I am sure that residents and visitors will enjoy seeing the procession.<br /><br />&#34;Opera Holland Park and the City of London Sinfonia will put on a fabulous performance, backed by a wonderful community choir to welcome the torch and its bearers.

In addition to the trading pitch the pair also won £1,000 each in start-up funds and a support package from the Prince&#39;s Trust.<br /> <br />Emily Ellen said: &#34;Time seems to be running away but I&#39;m confident that it will all come together. With the help of the Council&#39;s Education Business Partnership team I was able to hold my first art exhibition at the Louise Blouin Foundation and got some great feedback.  <br /> <br />&#34;After winning MELP I instantly created a checklist of all the things I needed to achieve before the launch date.  This involved sourcing various printing firms and working out the best way to buy in bulk and save money.  I&#39;ve started producing my art work on gift cards, book marks, post cards and, of course, still keeping up my canvases. Everything I purchase is logged so I can keep up to date with my funds.  I&#39;m currently in the process of setting up a meeting with HMRC so then I&#39;ll be fully prepared to deal with my tax when I start selling my work.&#34;<br /> <br />Jo Hawtree has been equally busy since winning last December. She&#39;s exhibited at the Ideal Home Show and Imperial College Rag Week Fashion Show and is working with a promotion company, Lottarox Agency, to have her label worn by emerging new musical talents. <br /> <br />Jo also got a loan from The Prince&#39;s Trust.

Visual and tactile lines distinguish pedestrian areas from those used by vehicles. Cars are slowed by a 20mph speed limit. <br /><br />A stunning chequered granite design runs from South Kensington Station to Hyde Park along the full width of the road from building to building. Kerbs, barriers and street clutter have been removed improving access, particularly for those using wheelchairs, push chairs and motorised buggies. Pedestrians can now walk from South Kensington Station to Hyde Park along a newly created public space. <br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;In Exhibition Road London now has a unique streetscape that will delight its many millions of visitors and which sets a new standard for urban design.<br /><br />&#34;The quality of this design has been recognised by RIBA and I&#39;d like to congratulate all associated with the project at Dixon Jones.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Exhibition Road","RIBA","cllr Paget-Brown",,,"The kerb-free, single surface Exhibition Road has won its third award since opening officially in February 2012.","Exhibition Road wins RIBA award"

Hundreds of thousands of spectators are expected to attend each road event and, given the road event routes, viewing capacity in central London will be very limited.<br /><br />TfL and London 2012 issued the following advice to spectators to ensure people enjoy the best possible Games-time experience:<br /><br />Advice to spectators:<br /> If you are planning to attend a road event, please arrive early, be prepared to wait for several hours and think carefully about bringing small children;<br /> Pack food and water, sun cream or waterproof clothing, depending on the weather;<br /> Think about the best viewing option for you, your friends and family.  For some, it may be better to view the event at one of the many Live Sites across the UK or on TV at home, with friends, at a pub or local community centre;<br /> For the Road Cycle Races on Saturday 28 and Sunday 29 July in particular, try to `stay local&#39; and enjoy the events as they pass through your local community;<br /> Have a back-up plan.  If it gets really busy, you might want to enjoy one of the wealth of free events, cultural and entertainment opportunities on offer across the UK and during London&#39;s summer like no other.

Go to www.GetAheadoftheGames.com which has all the tools and information you need about Road Events and how to plan your journey.<br /><br />TfL also repeated its advice to motorists and urged those in road event areas not to get caught out by the road closures necessary to stage the events.<br /><br />Advice to motorists:<br /> Motorists are advised to avoid central London, around the Olympic Route Network (ORN), venues and the road event courses;<br /> Don&#39;t get caught out - you will not be able to cross the race route by road;<br /> On road event days road closures will be in place from early morning;<br /> Instead, please use public transport, cycle or walk.<br /><br />Councillor Warwick Lightfoot, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Member Leader for 2012, said: &#34;We are only weeks away from the Games and it is very important that people who live and work in the borough are aware of the key dates and plan for the disruption that will occur.<br /><br />&#34;I would urge people to check out key websites such as www.getasheadofthegames.com to make sure they are aware of just when and where travel disruption will be at its worst.&#34;<br /><br />Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: &#34;London is gearing up to become a huge and wonderful sporting and cultural venue as we welcome the world for the Games.  The Road Events offer a great opportunity to see some of the world&#39;s top athletes in competition and to experience the numerous other attractions London has to offer.<br /><br />&#34;Given the huge numbers of people who will be in London for the Games, it is really important that people follow our travel advice and plan ahead.&#34;<br /><br />The majority of road events start and finish in central London, but some - including the Cycle Road Races and Cycling Time Trials - pass through south-west London and Surrey.  The Cycling Road Races on Saturday 28 and Sunday 29 July will take place on routes passing through Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, Kingston upon Thames, Wandsworth and Richmond upon Thames, as well as other parts of Surrey.<br /><br />To ensure the safety of athletes and spectators, road races need to take place on secure roads and closures and parking restrictions will need to be put in place on the days of the competitions.  These will be managed to keep disruption to a minimum and all roads will be opened as quickly as possible after the events have finished.  After the events, barriers will need to be removed, road signs, traffic lights and islands reinstated, roads thoroughly cleaned and crowds dispersed before roads can be reopened safely.<br /><br />The majority of road events will be held at weekends and some competitions will only take place for a few hours beginning in the morning.  Where possible, roads will be reopened and restrictions lifted by the late afternoon or early evening.  No roads will be closed overnight apart from the roads needed to build the Cycle Time Trial venue at Hampton Court Palace.<br /><br />A wealth of free events and cultural events will be happening in London&#39;s `Summer Like No Other&#39; as part of the `Mayor of London Presents&#39; programme.

That is a massive drop of 11.1 per cent since 2005 when the NEET figure was 15.9 per cent.<br /><br />Together with neighbouring boroughs Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster, who are part of the Tri-borough agreement to share children&#39;s services, the figure still remains lower than the national average, standing at 5.4 per cent.<br /><br />The news comes just days after the successful youth event, The Big SHOUT, where hundreds of young people aged 13 to 19 from all three boroughs were brought together for the first time. The young people met at Chelsea Football Club which has been working closely with the councils to host and support the event.<br /><br />Young people were given the chance to visit a CV and employment skills surgery to brush up on their interview techniques, find out how to write a CV and receive job advice. It is just one of the many ways in which the boroughs are helping more young people into employment and training. The councils are also offering six young people work experience placements during the summer.<br /><br />Chelsea FC Club Ambassador, Graeme Le Saux, said: &#34;The Big Shout is a great opportunity to bring the young people together through the boroughs and youth councils and offer them a whole range of opportunities to explore and see what is available to them in the local area.&#34;<br /><br />The day also included workshops and Question and Answer sessions with leading figures from the councils, health trusts and the Met Police, discussing issues such as sexual and emotional health, and communication between young people and the police.<br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said:  &#34;These are difficult times for young people and it is important they have as many opportunities as possible to develop skills and confidence to help them shape their future. <br /><br />&#34;We want to support them and to ensure we are delivering what they need and to make sure they are aware of what training and help is available. It is all about giving young people meaningful opportunities to develop skills, such as the football coaching scheme, which can lead to a qualification and perhaps a full time job.&#34;  <br /><br />Remi Smith, 21, from Kensington, had been unemployed for almost two months when he found support and training through one of several schemes provided in the Tri-borough areas. Remi, who had previously worked in Marks and Spencer, was helped onto the scheme by local careers advisors in both Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham. He is now two months through the `Let Me Play&#39; 30-week coaching programme. Trainees study for six qualifications, including an NVQ in sport and fitness, coaching and functional skills in maths, science and English. They also receive breakfast every morning, training clothes and the chance to apply for bursary funding, among other benefits. <br /><br />Remi said: &#34;I was looking to pursue a career in football coaching and I was pointed in the direction of Let Me Play. I had an informal interview, where they outlined what was expected of me if I got on the programme and then they accepted me. The scheme offers me practical and theoretical skills, and has helped give me experiences and skills I wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. <br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s been really good - the tutors are friendly and informative, and they give us advice and help when we need it. We also get to plan coaching sessions and then put them into practice to see how they work. <br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s been productive, I&#39;ve assessed my goals and what I want out of life, and it&#39;s made me look forward to my future. Now I&#39;ve got a positive outlook.&#34;<br /><br />Remi is now hoping that once he completes his NVQ he will be considered for a coaching role working with Fulham or even as a member of the Let Me Play team, when the company hosts a range of sporting sessions over the summer holidays.<br /><br />Other projects in the Tri-borough areas that are helping more young people than ever get into education, employment or training include Street Elite, Fulham FC Foundation, Reed in Partnership (London Volunteering) and Fast Forward.<br /><br />Cllr Helen Binmore, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham&#39;s Council&#39;s cabinet member for Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;We are proactive in our approach to helping young people into training, education and employment, and make sure we are talking and listening to our young people, understanding what they want to achieve in their lives. <br /><br />&#34;We allow them to take control of their destinies, by helping to build confidence and boost their morale while improving their skills, often by linking job training to sports, for example as we do with Chelsea, Fulham and QPR football clubs. And we also offer opportunities through work experience schemes, apprenticeships and early intervention through, for example, our youth clubs.&#34;<br /><br />The 300 young people at The Big SHOUT were joined by former Chelsea, Southampton and England footballer Graeme Le Saux, England basketball star Melita Emanuel-Carr and British rapper Joe Black, while staff from the councils were on hand to offer advice and guidance. <br /><br />Councillor Nickie Aiken, Cabinet Member for Children, Young People and Community Protection at Westminster City Council said: &#34;Our local young people are facing unprecedented challenges in getting the right training and experience and then nailing that all-important first job - and we owe it to them to provide all the support we can.<br /><br />&#34;The Big SHOUT proved young people are up to the challenge and ready to grab every opportunity that comes their way. I hope the event has given them a fresh perspective on training, CV-writing and other important career skills that will help them make a real impact on the jobs market in the future.&#34;<br /><br />The Summer in the City events guide was also launched, which showcases hundreds of council led events available to young people across west and central London this summer.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","employment, education or training","Councillor Elizabeth Campbell","the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea","Tri-borough","young people jobs","The number of young people in west London who are not in employment, education or training (NEET) is the lowest it has ever been - bucking the national trend.

Construction of the station and related development would make the largest contribution to employment, with 770 new jobs created.  The catalytic effect a station would have on the development of the Kensal site would make the largest financial contribution: a station, says Regeneris, would turbocharge the development of the 67-acre site adding approximately £300m in economic benefits.<br /><br />There would also be a significant impact on local consumer spending with the demand for goods and services created by an influx of new residents adding 360 jobs and £140 million to the local economy.<br /><br />The station would also boost the area as a business location adding a further 150 jobs and £100m, while the reduction in journey times for local residents and business would create benefits worth another £90 million.  <br /><br />Finally Regeneris also estimates the improvement in accessibility to all parts of London would assist 500 local residents into jobs leading to direct and indirect economic benefits valued at £10 million.<br /><br />In the report, Regeneris also highlights several other economic benefits where the values are more difficult to gauge.  For example, changes in perception of the area created by a new station; increases in land and property prices; reduced journey times to education and training facilities; the impacts of association with the Crossrail brand; decreases in congestion; and the opening up of a northern entrance to Portobello Road and Golborne Road Markets.<br /><br />Welcoming the report, the Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, said:  &#34;Our country desperately needs jobs and growth and this report is yet more evidence that we are ready and able to provide both in significant quantities.  <br /><br />&#34;It really is time for Crossrail to say yes to our Portobello station.&#34;<br /><br />The report is the second published by Regeneris this year (see www.rbkc.gov.uk/crossrail).  In February it published the results of its investigation into the regeneration arguments for a Crossrail station.  After looking at a wide range of measures of deprivation, it concluded that Kensal has a stronger regeneration case for a Crossrail station than any other location outside east London and that, had it been assessed at the outset of the Crossrail project, it &#34;...would almost certainly have been included in the top six opportunity station hinterlands&#34; identified by the London Development Agency as deserving a station on deprivation and equality grounds.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Crossrail","Portobello","Kensal","jobs","Economic","A Crossrail station on the site of the old Kensal Gas Works could boost the local economy by £690m and create 2,000 new jobs, according to a study published this week by economic analysts, Regeneris.","Six hundred and ninety million reasons to say yes to a Crossrail station for Portobello"

There are two sites: <br /><br /> The first fronts onto nearby Elkstone Road.  Formerly occupied by an elderly people&#39;s home and day centre, the site has been vacant since 2008 and is currently in temporary use as a coach park.<br /><br /> The other site lies to the south and immediately below the Tower.  It includes playspace, parts of the pedestrian walkways, stairs and basement car park/storage area, plus the ground floor of Trellick itself, which is currently in social use. <br /><br />The consultants&#39; brief is to come up with options for the redevelopment of the sites, including proposals for the layout and height of buildings, ideas for making best use of open space and plans for improving routes for vehicles and pedestrians.  Key to the project will be how the character, appearance and setting of Trellick Tower are to be preserved and enhanced. <br /><br />Trellick is Grade II listed, placing it in the top eight per cent of listed buildings in the country*.  Now in its 40th year, It needs considerable capital investment to maintain it in good order. <br /><br />Commenting on the study, Cabinet Member for Housing and Property, Cllr Timothy Coleridge, said:<br /><br />&#34;We need new homes, new facilities and new economic activity in this part of the borough.  But while we plan those, it must make sense to see if in some way development can also help resolve some of the financial challenges of maintaining Trellick Tower for the next 40 years.&#34;   <br /><br />As part of the study, the consultants will be involving local residents in discussions about the development of the sites, sharing with them the options as they emerge.   <br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Trellick tower","cllr coleridge",,,,"Whether land at the foot of Trellick Tower could be developed in order to help meet the cost of maintaining the iconic building will be one of the key issues explored in a study just commissioned by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.","Council seeks to secure Trellick&#39;s future through new development"

As part of that scheme, traditional street patterns that disappeared when the estate was built back in the 1960s and 70s will be reinstated. <br />Before the estate was built, the Portobello Road continued northwards until it connected with Ladbroke Grove.  After the redevelopment it will do so again, terminating at the eastern corner of the 67-acre Kensal site which is the focus of separate, even larger regeneration ambitions.<br /><br />If a Council-led campaign to bring a &#34;Portobello&#34; Crossrail station to the Kensal site succeeds, thousands of new homes, plus an array of new businesses and community facilities would become economically viable.  <br /><br />In fact, the Council is currently consulting on a range of development options for Kensal.  One of the options under discussion for example, envisages a waterside style development with 3,500 homes, a reinstated canal basin and a new bridge across the rail tracks. <br /><br />In a recently published report, leading economic analyst, Regeneris, estimates that a Crossrail station would create 2,000 new jobs and add £690 million to the local economy.  And in an earlier report Regeneris showed there was a stronger case for a station on the Kensal site than at any other confirmed station site outside of east London, concluding that had Kensal been looked at from the outset, it would certainly have been included in the original Crossrail plans. <br /><br />&#34;Taken together, the new Wornington Green, the redevelopment of the Kensal site and the step change in transport options provided by a Portobello Station would utterly transform this large, disadvantaged neighbourhood and give a massive boost to the local and London economy ,&#34; said  the Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell.<br /><br />&#34;That&#39;s the big picture and we are doing everything we can to get the Crossrail authorities to see it before it is too late.&#34;<br /><br />Wornington Green developers, Catalyst Housing Ltd, are long-standing supporters of the Portobello Crossrail campaign.  <br /><br />&#34;A Portobello station would make a real difference to our existing tenants and those buying into our development in terms of the quality of life and economic opportunity north and south of the Harrow Road,&#34; said Rod Cahill Catalyst&#39;s Chief Executive.  <br /><br />&#34;That&#39;s why we agree that it is time to say yes to a Portobello Crossrail station.&#34;<br /><br />As well as contributing to wider regeneration, the hope is that the extension of Portobello Road and a new Portobello station would together help to secure the future of Portobello and Golborne Markets.  Not only will the extension to Portobello have new retail space at ground floor level it will connect with the eastern end of the Kensal development site on which the station would be built.  That station would be capable of delivering new day trippers from the east and west of the Capital and eventually from the Midlands once HS2 is complete.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Crossrail","Portobello",,,,"World famous Portobello Road is to be extended northwards as part of a major regeneration scheme in North Kensington.","Portobello Crossrail station the missing link in renaissance of Portobello Road"

This year&#39;s victor was Merlin Dwan of the London Rowing Club in a time of 24 minutes and 28 seconds.    <br /><br />The Mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor Christopher Buckmaster, greeted the competitors at the end of the four miles and seven furlongs course that stretches from London Bridge to Cadogan Pier in Chelsea. <br /><br />Mysteriously, this annual event passes largely unnoticed, despite the thrilling races it often provides and its impressive longevity; the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race is a mere whippersnapper in comparison, starting in only 1829.<br /><br />Thomas Doggett was an Irish actor and comedian who came to London around the year 1690.  After playing many parts at Drury Lane he became its manager.  <br /><br />The Watermen of the Thames, who were much more numerous than they are today, were then the equivalent of the modern taxi driver.   They were licensed to row passengers along and across the River Thames.  No doubt Doggett relied heavily on their services.  A staunch Whig, opposed to any restoration of the Stuarts, he funded the race to commemorate the first anniversary of the accession of the Hanoverian George I.<br /><br />Thomas Doggett himself organised the race until his death in 1721.  In his will, he instructed his executors to endow the race, which was to be managed by Mr Edward Burt of the Admiralty Office.  Mr Burt was apparently unwilling to assume the burden laid upon him by Doggett and it was arranged that the executors should pay over to the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers the sum of £300 and that the Company, which added £50 to the fund, should henceforth carry out Doggett&#39;s wishes. <br /><br />The Fishmongers&#39; Company has faithfully complied with their undertaking ever since, despite the not inconsiderable rise in costs since 1721.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","doggetts coat and badge",,,,,"Five competitors fought fiercely for Doggett&#39;s Coat and Badge last Friday, in a boat race that has been taking place on the River Thames each year since 1715.

The idea is that it will reflect the very latest and best practice.  In particular there would be greatly improved internal and external space for social and recreational use.   <br /><br />However, to achieve planning permission, the Council must first satisfy stringent planning standards and keep local people informed about and involved in the development of the scheme.<br /><br />That will involve plans being published on the Council&#39;s website at www.rbkc.gov.uk/eastrow and at least one public exhibition, which has already been scheduled for Thursday 20 September at the nearby St. Mary&#39;s Roman Catholic Primary School.  In the meantime local residents can email ERCH@rbkc.gov.uk if they have any concerns or questions.<br /><br />If the new home is built, the present home at Whistler Walk, World&#39;s End Estate, will close.  As a home, Whistler Walk has long been praised by inspectors for its exceptional standards of care. As a building however, it leaves much to be desired. Built in the 1970s, the internal layout feels institutional and doesn&#39;t easily lend itself to the creation of a homely, family atmosphere.

When the bollards have been removed, vehicles create a hazard in what is supposed to be a peaceful residential haven where children can play.  And they also regularly damage the paving.<br /><br />However, while Westfield has led to more cars, it has also sharply increased the number of pedestrians, meaning that far more people will enjoy the new Norland Road about to be created.<br /><br />The proposal is to introduce robust, new vehicle barriers as part of a wider renovation scheme that will include new street lighting, trees and granite paving that will transform the streetscape.<br /><br />&#34;Norland Road is a haven for local people but also a minor gateway to North Kensington,&#34; said Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Council.  <br /><br />&#34;I&#39;m delighted to be giving the green light to a scheme that will serve both functions, keeping illegal parkers out and providing a beautiful street for pedestrians to pass through on their way to Westfield or north to Portobello.&#34;<br /><br />The scheme will cost £635,000, of which £485,000 is coming from TfL&#39;s allocation to the Council for transport improvements, the remainder from the Council&#39;s own Streetscape budget.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Norland Road","cllr Paget-Brown","redevelopment ",,,"A pedestrianised part of Norland Road is to have a dramatic makeover to improve its appearance and protect it from illegal traffic.","Dramtic makeover for Norland Road"

Over nine days 60,000 visitors witnessed unforgettable culture, science and entertainment. Everyone came together to celebrate London&#39;s Olympic Games on Exhibition Road through music, dance, acrobatics, art, science and literature. <br /><br />Road Show was conceived by the Royal Borough as a celebration of the Olympic Games on London&#39;s most elegant road, and the event highlighted the openness and accessibility of the space. <br /><br />The Exhibitionists, the event&#39;s resident troupe of young dancers and circus performers, proved a popular draw. Whether suspended by a harness from the front of Imperial College, striking a breathtaking pose on the balcony of the V&#38;A, or in perfect formation on the road, the Exhibitionists brought a unique excitement and energy to the programme. <br /><br />Inspired by an international music programme spanning classical, contemporary, pop and folk music, visitors danced on Exhibition Road, swinging to the retro sounds of GI Jive, silently moving to the bass-heavy Kidnap Kid &#38; Woz, and following the beat of Ebony Steelband. Hotly tipped Sam Lee played his unique brand of folk music, while rising star Josephine Oniyama proved once again that she&#39;s a massive British talent. There was also a memorable moment when a 17-year old busker was given an impromptu spot on the main stage, to a rapturous reception. Simon Fisher Turner&#39;s newly commissioned score for Herbert Ponting&#39;s `The Great White Silence&#39; also provided a special moment as the classic film accompanied by the live score was projected onto the side of the Natural History Museum.<br /><br />Science in all its diversity was explored through workshops, a handmade particle accelerator and guided tours of the Science Museum.<br /><br />Road Show&#39;s three visual art commissions investigated unique aspects of the natural world; from Katie Paterson&#39;s `Campo del Cielo, Field of the Sky&#39;, a 4.5 billion year old meteorite outside the Royal Geographic Society to a bird&#39;s eye commentary from high up in the V&#38;A provided by Graeme Miller&#39;s `On Air&#39;, to Tomas Libertiny&#39;s `The Agreement&#39;, an intricate, living sculpture made by bees.<br /><br />Visitors to Road Show found much to engage them: vintage games re-imagined with `Games for the Games&#39;; some very special readings from `Road Stories&#39;, including a reading of Russell Hoban&#39;s last story by his son Jake; and a delicious array of food from the street traders&#39; collective Eat St. <br /><br />Cllr Warwick Lightfoot, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member responsible for 2012, said:<br /><br />&#34;I&#39;m pleased with the success of Exhibition Road Show. It demonstrates the creative and scientific expertise of Kensington and Chelsea. From workshops that explored patterning in the natural world to Irish dancing in the road, <br />Exhibition Road Show had something to entertain, stimulate and delight everyone. 98 per cent of the visitors to the event who were surveyed told us that they thought that Road Show was good, very good or excellent. That&#39;s a lot of people taking home good memories of the Royal Borough.

Fortuitously association member, Kim Taylor Smith, spotted just the right design during a trip to Pisa, Italy and tracked down the manufacturer.  Mr Taylor Smith explained: &#34;The fountain was shipped to the UK and installed by the Royal Borough. It was originally painted a bright green but we gave it a coat of dark green paint in keeping with the park.&#34; <br /><br />Speaking at the unveiling of the fountain Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell said: &#34;St Luke&#39;s Gardens is a very popular park and I&#39;m sure its visitors, especially youngsters, will be grateful that there is fresh water on tap thanks to the thoughtfulness and generosity of the Sydney Street and District Residents&#39; Association.

So for example, someone living or working in Kensington and Chelsea will then be able to use their existing Kensington and Chelsea library card to borrow books and other items from libraries in Hammersmith &#38; Fulham or Westminster.<br /><br />The move means that a one year old, living to the average life expectancy of 81, would need to read at least 26 books every day for the rest of their lives if they wanted to get through the entire Tri-borough collection.<br /><br />To mark the launch of the new system, Hammersmith-based artist Gianandrea Traina has crafted a sculpture made entirely out of books to spell the number `1,000,000&#39; in Victoria Library, reflecting the number of books which will be available to residents across the three boroughs under the new library card system.<br /><br />The Tri-borough councils agreed last year to combine the management of several of their departments, including libraries, to save money and protect front line services.<br /><br />Commenting on the launch of the One Library Card, Westminster City Council Leader Cllr Philippa Roe said:<br /><br />&#34;We are firmly committed to keeping our libraries open, and the launch of the One Library Card is proof that our tri-borough programme is not only helping to save money and protect our libraries, but it is dramatically improving our existing service.<br /><br />&#34;The One Library Card effectively unlocks one million books, as well as access to specialist book groups and collections, for people who live, work or study in our three boroughs. This is a huge victory for literacy in London and will revolutionise the role our libraries can play in central and west London.&#34;<br /><br />The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Leader, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, added: &#34;Through tri-borough we will continue to offer excellent library services with a strong focus on innovation and development to meet the current and future needs of our local communities. By combining senior management and working closely with our neighbours we are ensuring that our libraries will continue to thrive at a time when library services in other parts of the capital are under pressure.&#34;<br />                                                 <br />The benefits of the new One Library Card do not just stop at borrowing books. Residents, workers and students in the three boroughs will now be able to do all of the following:<br /><br /> Borrow books, DVDs, CDs and games from any tri-borough library<br /> Use computers at any library across the three boroughs (there are a total of 470 PCs available for public use)<br /> Use study facilities in any library<br /> Benefit from better opening hours - for example, nine libraries open on a Sunday across the three boroughs<br /> Attend events at any library, including events for babies and children<br /> Join reading groups or other activity groups at any library<br /> Access specialist collections across the three boroughs, including some rare items and items of national significance. Collections include the music collection at Victoria Library, fashion collection at Chelsea Library, art and design collection at Westminster Reference Library and a collection of fine art books at Fulham Library.<br /><br />The One Library Card is the latest way in which the Tri-borough arrangement between Westminster, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham is making library services better for residents and offering greater value for council tax payers&#39; money. The innovative programme, which also involves combining management between the councils&#39; children&#39;s services, adult social care and pensions and treasury departments, is on track to save £40m a year across the three authorities by 2015/16, enabling the boroughs to keep important services like libraries open for residents.<br /><br />H&#38;F Council Leader Cllr Nicholas Botterill said: &#34;This `library passport&#39; means that lucky West London residents can now access more free books than they could ever have dreamt of.<br />                                            <br />&#34;Libraries are a gateway to a world of knowledge, excitement and inspiration.

However, there are a number of concerns for which the Council has asked for reassurance:<br /> <br />         That all NHS and Foundation Trusts in north-west London post-implementation of the proposals are financially robust.<br />         That the new system will have sufficient capacity to provide services to what is likely to be a growing and ageing population. This relates to reduction in bed numbers especially but also to out of hospital provision.<br />         It would like external reassurance that Chelsea and Westminster and St Mary&#39;s have the capacity to meet increased demand from A&#38;E closures at other hospitals<br />         If the A&#38;E department was to close at Charing Cross the Council wants to be reassured that there are satisfactory plans for the future use of the Charing Cross site and relocation of specialties currently interdependent with the A&#38;E Service.<br />         It is concerned at the poor quality of buildings at St Mary&#39;s so would like to see the detail on the plans to build capacity there<br />         That there were robust plans in place to stop bed blocking and delayed discharge. It is recognised that this Council needs to contribute towards this.<br />         That out of hospital recommendations made by the Council are addressed by NHS NWL.<br />         On the timings for the delivery of the programme. The Council has asked what are the triggers for making changes to the plans if things are not working out as expected?<br /> <br />Cllr Fiona Buxton, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care, said: &#34;We have looked at the options outlined in the consultation document in great depth. The Chelsea and Westminster Foundation Trust has a modern hospital building which achieves excellent clinical outcomes on the Fulham Road. It should continue to provide a full Accident and Emergency Service.<br /> <br />&#34;There are still a number of areas of concern for which we are seeking assurances. Amongst these are that all NHS and Foundation Trusts in north-west London should be financially robust  after implementation of the proposals and that the new system will have sufficient capacity to provide services to what is likely to be a growing and ageing population. This relates to reduction in bed numbers especially but also to out of hospital provision.&#34;<br /> <br />Cllr Mary Weale, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Chairman of the Health, Environmental Health and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee, said: &#34;I was very pleased that so many local people attended the public meeting to examine these important proposals.  We have decided that Option A is our favoured proposal but it is very important that as many people as possible have their say on the future of major hospitals in the area.  This is why I would encourage people to study this document and send their comments to NHS North West London.&#34;<br /> <br />For more information on the consultation go to: www.healthiernorthwestlondon.nhs.uk/contact-us<br /> <br />Comments can be sent by 8 October to: consultation@nw.london.nhs.uk<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NHS","weale","  buxton",,,"A major reorganisation of the NHS in north-west London is planned and the Council is asking residents to make sure they have their say on proposals.","Have your say on NHS reorganisation"

It has the lowest survival rate of all cancers.  <br /><br />Speaking at the launch of the Mayor&#39;s Annual Charitable Appeal, &#39;The Magic Wand Appeal&#39;, on Thursday 11 October at Kensington Town Hall, Cllr Buckmaster said:  &#34;I aim to increase public awareness of the desperate need for more funding and to raise funds for research at Imperial College&#39;s Charing Cross Hospital, ultimately to create there an International Centre of Excellence in Brain Tumour Research.  All donations or funds raised by my appeal will go directly to the research.<br /><br />&#34;The specific aim of my appeal is to purchase a new and revolutionary surgical tool called the Sonowand: a state of the art neuro navigational system that converts pre-operative MRI scans into a virtual reconstruction of the brain, enabling surgeons to operate more accurately.&#34;<br /><br />Consultant neurosurgeon and chairman of the Brain Tumour Research Campaign, Mr Kevin O&#39;Neill, said that statistics proved patient survival and outcomes are better if Sonowand equipment is available during surgery.<br /><br />Imperial College&#39;s Charing Cross Hospital is one of only two units in the country with a Sonowand. It treats over 300 tumour cases per year but demand is growing. Recent estimates from the National Cancer Intelligence Network indicate that approximately 840 Londoners are diagnosed with a brain, central nervous system or intracranial tumour each year and currently over 2,500 people are treated in London hospitals for tumours relating to the brain or central nervous system.<br /><br />The Mayor&#39;s Christmas Carol Concert on Thursday 6 December is one of a series of events planned to raise funds for the Sonowand and Brian Tumour Research Campaign. <br /><br />If you would like to donate to the Mayor&#39;s Appeal or book tickets for the Carol Concert email mayor@rbck.gov.uk or phone 020 73612431 or 020 73613659","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL"," Cllr Christopher Buckmaster,","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea","Brain Tumour Research Campaign ","Kevin O&#39;Neill,",,"The Mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Christopher Buckmaster, has pledged to use his Mayor&#39;s Charitable Appeal to raise funds for the Brain Tumour Research Campaign and buy a £250,000 Sonowand, a vital piece of neurosurgery equipment, for Imperial College&#39;s Charing Cross Hospital.","Mayor launches Magic Wand appeal to help brain tumour research"

The new six storey building is divided into two distinct halves, separated by a central atrium stretching the full length of the building and linked by a series of walkways on each level.<br /><br />Key features include:<br /> large, well designed classrooms <br /> modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) <br /> full disabled access <br /> excellent informal spaces for social interaction <br /> a learning resource centre <br /> significantly improved facilities for the sixth form <br /> high quality dance, drama, arts, science and technology facilities <br /> improved opportunities for community <br /> a more secure learning environment <br /><br />Specifically on sport and play there is:<br /> a 25m swimming pool <br /> a four court sports hall <br /> a fitness suite <br /> a synthetic turf all-weather sports pitch <br /> retention of the existing tennis courts <br /> a four tennis court-sized multi-use games area (`MUGA&#39;) <br /> improved landscaping across the site <br /> sports lighting <br /> informal covered play/teaching areas in addition to informal, social and habitat areas<br /><br />This replaces the 1950s buildings which were dispersed across what by central London standards was an unusually large site.<br /><br />It was realised that by consolidating all school activity into a single, large building on the northern part of the site, the land to the south could be released for sale to help meet the cost of the new school.  And this being Kensington and Chelsea, the land values were such that there was a good chance the sale might pay for the school outright.<br /><br />Though the new Holland Park is now on a smaller site, in every other way it is larger than its predecessor.  <br /><br />As described above, the school was on a large site but because of the configuration of the buildings and landscaping, much of that space wasn&#39;t suitable for sports or even just informal play.<br /><br />Outdoor pitches at the school took the form of a tarmac area where falls could easily result in injury.  <br /><br />The new school will not only provide an increase in the amount of space for formal and informal games, that space will also be of greatly superior quality and of far more benefit to future students.<br /> <br />Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;Holland Park is already an outstanding school with good discipline and excellent exam results. Now it has some of the best facilities anywhere in the state sector too.  It&#39;s a proud moment for the Council, the school and our contractors.&#34;<br /><br />Colin Hall, Head of Holland Park, said: &#34;We are thrilled to have reached the closing stages of a journey that began over a decade ago and which has benefited from the enthusiasm and guiding hand of the Royal Borough. <br /><br />&#34;We think our new building is `iconic&#39;, dynamic, original and wonderfully constructed. It is a new London landmark, setting a new standard for such public buildings. <br /><br />&#34;We have every confidence that our students will imbibe its splendour and repay the investment by continuing to succeed so spectacularly. <br /><br />&#34;In a year of all time record results for the school, it is a splendid moment in time to begin a new chapter of history in the new Holland Park School.&#34;<br /><br />Sir John Baker, Chair of the Governing Body, said: &#34;The new School building is, quite simply, magnificent. We have watched it rise out of the ground with great anticipation and now we can see it, experience it, live in it and work in it.<br /><br />&#34;We are rejoicing in its fusion of design and functionality. We are proud of our school and proud of our new building: we will redouble our energies to ensure that Holland Park School continues to provide the very best in comprehensive education for our students and to repay the faith of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the community in the investment it has made in this wonderful building.&#34;<br /><br />To pay for the school, the Council has sold the southern part of the old school site for residential development.  Planning permission has been granted for 72 homes.  The homes will be arranged in a U-shape around a central landscaped courtyard and include a children&#39;s play space.  All will be built to lifetime homes standards. Pedestrian and vehicle access will be from Campden Hill. <br /><br />As planning gain, the Council has funded two outstanding residential developments, one on Ifield Road, in Chelsea, the other at Silchester Garages in North Kensington.  At Ifield Road, it has paid for 20 new units of social housing, at Silchester, 63 units of affordable and intermediate housing. <br /><br />The sale of the southern site has generated £105 million.  From the outset the Council has set out to build the optimum new school for Holland Park, the specification is therefore unusually high. Nevertheless the sale not only pays for the school outright it has funded two high quality developments of affordable housing and it will also contribute a very substantial sum towards the construction of other new schools in the borough.<br /><br />Construction of the school building was completed in September 2012.  Pupils will move in during the autumn half term.  The temporary school will then be removed so that work on the pitches and landscaping can begin; that is scheduled to complete in November 2013.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Holland Park School","cllr coleridge","school  ","property","cllr cockell","Holland Park School, one of the country&#39;s first and most famous comprehensive schools, is moving into a magnificent new building.","Magnificent new Holland Park School building completed"

Councillors agree on the projects to be funded with support from the community. The scheme has been running for one year now and the Tea Together events provide an opportunity for residents to find out what has happened in the first year and to suggest ideas for projects to be taken forward.<br /> <br />At the Holland Park event a number of residents suggested activities to tackle the issue of isolation among older residents; wanted advice on how to set up community gardens or get involved with an existing one and developing activities for young children. <br /> <br />Cabinet Member for Civil Society, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen, said: &#34;I&#39;m delighted and encouraged that so many residents attended last Saturday&#39;s Tea Together. It is a great opportunity for residents and Councillors to work together to improve their neighbourhoods as part of our flagship City Living, Local Life initiative. <br /> <br />&#34;There is no limit to the number of projects that may be agreed by a ward provided it is within budget.

The group&#39;s aim is to promote reading and literature in a way that fits in with modern lifestyles and uses technology to bring people together.<br /><br />The group will change book every one to two months, and future book choices and directions for the group will be dictated by feedback and suggestions from members. The forum is also open for more general discussions of books people are reading, outside of the current book choice for the group.<br /><br />The Text Tribe group is the latest announcement for the three London councils&#39; Tri-borough libraries and archives service, which is part of a wider programme between the local authorities to combine senior and middle management, save money and keep libraries open across the three boroughs.<br /><br />Commenting on the new online book group, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Libraries, Cllr Elizabeth Campbell, said: &#34;By combining our service delivery we are not only keeping all our libraries open but through Text Tribe we will provide 24/7 access to a reading group and give people the opportunity to discuss at anytime what is exciting or annoying them about the books they are reading.&#34;<br /><br />Westminster City Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Services, Cllr Lee Rowley, added: &#34;A lot of Londoners are so busy they scarcely have time to read a book, let alone put regular time aside for attending a book group meeting. So we&#39;re hoping this new online forum will encourage Londoners to read more while better reflecting their busy lives and increased use of technology.<br /><br />&#34;It will also help local readers to exchange opinions on the books they&#39;re reading with a more diverse array of people. It&#39;s good news for reading and literacy in London, and the latest in a string of innovative announcements from our tri-borough libraries service.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Greg Smith, Deputy Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, said: &#34;The online reading group shows once again that by thinking innovatively, it is possible to improve the library service we offer to residents. By combining library management, we have been able to secure the future of all our 21 branches - but you do not even need to visit a library to reap the benefits of this scheme.&#34;                                                                                                     <br />Speaking ahead of the launch event, author Mark Billingham said: &#34;Reading groups are a hugely important way to spread the word about books and to share the pleasure of a good read with others.

The improvements include external cladding to provide an effective rain screen; double glazing to reduce noise, improve thermal efficiency and fuel economy; and new controlled heating and water systems.  <br /> <br />Now it has also been revealed that two well used and much loved community facilities will receive a welcome boost. The Grenfell under three&#39;s nursery will move from its current location on the mezzanine level to the ground floor near a fenced play area. It will have a new lift installed making it easier to access the outdoors and the new space will have more natural light and be better laid out.<br /><br />The Dale Boxing Club currently occupies the ground floor and is a very small facility for a vibrant and successful club which has produced several champions and a gold medallist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The plans will see the club relocated to walkway level. It will benefit from more space, better facilities and high ceilings across the gym - something their existing club doesn&#39;t have - so all of it can be used for sparring and training. The new improved facilities will enable the club to bid for grants from the Amateur Boxing Association. <br /><br />Unused space at the Tower&#39;s base will also be opened up and six four-bedroom and one three-bedroom homes will be created for families on the housing waiting list. This remodelling work will also create an improved communal entrance, new office facilities and better walkway access. The residents of nearby Verity Close will also benefit from double glazing.<br /><br />Councillor Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Housing, said:<br /><br />&#34;Not only are we building a new academy and leisure centre for North Kensington but we are also making significant improvements to Grenfell Tower, its facilities and the surrounding area. <br /><br />&#34;Residents of the Tower will not only have a better environment to live in but their homes will be much cheaper to run.<br /><br />&#34;During such challenging economic times we are proud that the Council has invested almost £50m in the area and it&#39;s sure to leave a long-lasting legacy for future generations.&#34;<br /><br />Known as the Grenfell Tower Regeneration Project the works will be overseen by the TMO and carried out by the same team who are handling the academy and leisure centre programme.  With architects, Studio E, and contractor, Leadbitter, on board the works can be carried as cost-effectively and quickly as possible, minimising disruption to residents.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Grenfell Tower ","North Kensington ","Tenant Management Organisation ","External cladding ","Dale Boxing Club ","Further details have now emerged on improvements to Grenfell Tower following last month&#39;s announcement of a magnificent new academy and leisure centre for North Kensington.","Further details on Grenfell Tower improvements unveiled"

The Inspectorate felt that neighbours were suffering as a result of the property being used as a café, rather than for retail.  Jaks Holding Ltd was given until June 2011 to comply with the ruling.  It applied again for retrospective planning permission in June 2011, which was again turned down and this decision was again supported by the Planning Inspectorate.<br /><br />At West London Magistrates&#39; Court Mr Seferi, the lone director of Jaks Holding Ltd and proprietor of Jaks pleaded guilty to the charge of non-compliance with an enforcement notice.<br /><br />Mr Seferi was fined £14,000 and ordered to pay costs of £710, while Jaks Holdings Ltd were fined £17,500 and ordered to pay costs of £1,812.<br /><br />Commenting on the case, Councillor Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Planning, said: &#34;It is important that people and businesses work within the framework of the planning system.

"4257","31/10/2012 18:07:00","COUNCILS LEAD RADICAL REFORM OF PUBLIC SERVICES ","Three west London councils are today proposing major public service reform to save local taxpayers&#39; £80 million-a-year while putting economic growth at the heart of the proposals.  <br /><br />Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster City Council say that if the proposals are adapted and implemented in other areas they have the potential to save the UK billions of pounds by reducing dependency on the state while providing better public services, more jobs, and more affordable homes .<br /><br />The three councils, which have led the way in local government by combining services, are one of just four areas in the country to be given special `Community Budget pilot&#39; status by the Government to develop seven radical plans for public service redesign. <br /><br />Phillipa Roe, Leader of Westminster City Council, said: &#34;Our proposals will stimulate our local economies, create the affordable housing we need, improve the lives of our residents and ensure that taxpayers get better value out of every pound spent.&#34;<br /><br />The plans, which have been submitted to Government, include:<br /><br />Putting employment prospects at the heart of the school day<br /><br />Young people would be given a `jobs passport&#39; when they leave school which demonstrates to employers their skills, experience and aptitude.  An employment programme running from the first year of secondary school through to sixth form and Further Education would complement academic learning by preparing young people for the realities of the jobs market. Young people will be taught about the local jobs market, they will be encouraged to volunteer and the work experience placement offer will be overhauled.<br /><br />Every young person will receive a graded `jobs passport&#39; when they leave education which provides potential employers with evidence of their skills, experience and aptitude.  Pupils who are identified at an early stage to be struggling will receive more intensive support.  <br /><br />The trial is set to run in six schools across Tri-Borough over two years, benefitting 3,500 pupils and potentially saving between £1.5 and £2.5 million annually. <br /><br />Councillor Nicholas Botterill, Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, said: &#34;This will bridge the disconnect between what is taught in schools and what is required from employers. Our aim is to ensure that every young person leaving education is ready for employment.&#34;<br /><br />Boosting house building and creating more jobs <br /><br />Existing local authority housing stock should be used to finance the construction of new homes that are targeted at middle-income earning families, under the proposals.<br /><br />The three councils have asked for greater financial freedoms to use their £2.4bn of assets to borrow £50million needed to build 300 homes, creating 700 construction jobs in the process.<br /><br />They also want new flexibilities to charge fairer rents for had working middle-income families who are being squeezed out of central London housing markets. The proposals would eventually generate a surplus of £500,000 a year, part of which will be used to help 270 existing unemployed social housing tenants find jobs. <br /><br />Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,  said: &#34;Using our existing housing assets to give us the financial capability to build more homes makes perfect sense. We want to create a housing ladder of opportunity, using the revenue this creates to help people further down the ladder.&#34;<br /><br />Integrating health and social care to help more people stay in their own home<br /><br />Plans have been submitted to save around £66 million per year by integrating health and social care support to enable more people to stay independent in their own home.<br /><br />The integrated model will provide targeted support to 20 per cent of people who are currently responsible for 77 per cent of health and social care cost. They will be given help and support to be cared for in their own homes, reducing demand for more expensive institutionalised care either in a hospital setting or residential home. <br /><br />Nationally the NHS needs to save £20 billion by 2014/15 in order to manage rising demand, particularly the pressure from a growing elderly population.<br /><br />&#34;We will focus more on prevention and providing the right support for people in their own homes which is much more effective for the individual and their family and much better for the taxpayer,&#34; said Cllr Roe, Leader of Westminster City Council. <br /><br />&#34;This is about changing the way primary health and social care services are delivered, with acute or residential care becoming the last resort not the first destination.&#34;<br /><br />Extending care proceedings pilot nationally<br /><br />Results from a care proceedings pilot launched by the three councils in April to dramatically speed up the majority of children&#39;s care cases have been submitted to Government in the hope it will be rolled out more widely across London. <br /><br />The pilot is intended to achieve targets set out by the Government for children to have a permanent care plan resolved by the court as soon as possible, and for court proceeding to last no longer than six months.<br /><br />Indications show the pilot, which started on 1 April, has dramatically reduced the duration of care proceedings cases from a previous average of 58 weeks to just 26 weeks. The scheme is expected to save £1.9 million a year from the public purse and has the potential to save tens of millions of pounds nationally. <br /><br />The pilot involves a new way of working between the three local authorities, family court judges and Cafcass, in which the councils&#39; social workers agree to deliver their assessments promptly and to a set standard, and judges place the child&#39;s timescales at the heart of their decision making. <br /><br /><br />Reducing adult reoffending <br /><br />Proposals to shift resources and support to short sentenced prisoners will cut reoffending by 10 per cent and deliver economic benefits and savings for taxpayers of up to £25 million over five years.<br /><br />The councils want to create a Tri-Borough Custody Referral Team to engage with all offenders at the earliest point, testing for all drugs and providing preliminary screening for alcohol issues, mental health and learning difficulties.  A dedicated Reducing Reoffending Team will provide bespoke support around the needs of short sentenced prisoners, within custody, through to release into the community. The support package will be based on a contract of active engagement and the service will work closely with the police to enforce against those who continue to offend.<br /><br />Figures show that short sentenced prisoners are more likely to reoffend than longer term prisoners. The prolific nature of their offending has a significant impact on local communities, including violence, theft and burglary. By providing more targeted help earlier and focussing on a cohort who receive very little support or supervision currently, it has the potential to deliver economic benefits and savings for tax payers of up to £25 million over five years, while  reducing local spend on reoffending by between £1.2 million and £6.1 million over five years.<br /><br />Expanding support for families with complex needs<br /><br />The Government is being asked to support and incentivise local investment to help more families whose lives are in danger of spiralling out of control.<br /><br />The three councils want to extend and expand the Government&#39;s current approach around helping troubled families beyond the current 2014/15 funding period. However, to make this work they are asking the Government to provide a fair funding solution, which rewards greater local investment.<br /><br />Putting economic growth at the heart of infrastructure projects<br /><br />Billions of pounds worth of economic growth would be generated if Whitehall departments worked more closely with local authorities on major infrastructure projects, say the three councils. <br /><br />Multi-billion pound schemes - like High Speed 2 (HS2) - are often planned in Government `silos&#39; limiting their potential.<br /><br />The £32 billion rapid rail link between London and Birmingham will see a new generation of high speed trains, running at speeds of up to 250mph, stopping at a major new interchange station just north of Wormwood Scrubs.<br /><br />However, there are currently no firm HS2 plans for `over-site&#39; development at the station and the local councils argue that HS2 would be capable of delivering many more new jobs and homes than currently envisaged if Government departments worked more closely with them.<br /><br />If the railway design was optimised to facilitate development above and around the HS2 hub station, as well as the Kensal Green Crossrail station, the area could deliver 21,000 new homes and 196,000 new jobs.<br /><br />Cllr Nicholas Botterill, Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, said: &#34;HS2 has the potential to unleash the creation of a new business hub bigger than Canary Wharf but only if Whitehall start seeing this as a regeneration project, which needs local input and expertise, rather than just a railway project.&#34;<br /><br />The community budget proposals<br /><br />The proposals are being submitted to Government on 31 October. In many cases there are `asks&#39; of Government to help implement the plans. The three councils are calling on Whitehall and government agencies to work closer with local government and their partners, providing new financial freedoms, breaking down budgetary silos and sharing data. <br /><br />Cllr Botterill, Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, said: &#34;We have submitted a series of reforms which will reduce the burden on the public purse, attract new economic growth and improve the lives of our residents. Many people may see these proposals as plain old commonsense, but the fact is that we need Government to join the party to make much of this work.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Roe, Leader of Westminster City Council, added: &#34;As three of the country&#39;s leading councils, we are eager to get on and deliver but as things stand councils are not always beneficiaries of the savings. Councils cannot afford to put in the upfront investment if the dividends are reaped by Whitehall depts.  This is why it is essential that Government helps us pool resources and give us the freedoms to do our jobs.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, Leader of The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;Local Government is the most efficient arm of government in this country, through these proposals we are proving that we are the most innovative.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, The Royal Borough of Ken","Sir Merrick Cockell","Community Budget pilot&#39; ",,,"Three west London councils are today proposing major public service reform to save local taxpayers&#39; £80 million-a-year while putting economic growth at the heart of the proposals.

The bond between siblings is unique and in many cases is the most consistent relationship that they have had.  Wherever possible the councils aim to place siblings together. <br /> <br />Unfortunately sibling groups often wait the longest to be placed for adoption.  Adopters are often concerned about whether they will be able to manage the demands of more than one child joining their family at the same time.  <br /> <br />The Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Service, Cllr Elizabeth Campbell said:  &#34;I would like to encourage anyone who is considering adoption to come along to one of these information evenings to find out more and encourage people to consider adopting siblings together.

It has taken endless supplies of patience, love, nurturing and understanding to get us where we are today.  The pay-out is enormous and the transformation in him has been amazing!

As a big spending department Children&#39;s Services needs to play its part in delivering significant savings, amounting to 27 per cent over a three-year period.<br /><br />Reorganising children&#39;s centres into two locality groups, one north of Kensington High Street, the other south of it will simplify management and reduce associated costs while protecting front line services.<br /><br />A further major benefit would be that the borough&#39;s children&#39;s centres would then align with Ofsted&#39;s new inspection arrangements.  This reduction in the inspection burden would also save money, and reduce stress.<br /><br />Currently the Council provides full daycare in four of its children&#39;s centres and now the Council will explore outsourcing childcare at these centres.  In the Royal Borough there is a thriving private and voluntary sector with the proven capability to provide high quality care at lower cost to the Council than the present arrangement.  The Council will test the market next month and if a new provider is selected they would take over running the centres from autumn 2013.<br /><br />120 childcare places are available to fee-paying parents - this represents 5.9 per cent of the total childcare places in the borough.

During the month anti-fraud investigators from the Royal Borough and Westminster will share data and resources with Peabody to investigate suspected fraud. Any properties which are recovered as a result of successful investigations will be allocated to the councils to be relet to people on housing waiting lists. <br /><br />Launching the fraud awareness month with the support of the National Fraud Authority (NFA), the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Peabody Housing Association, the three councils announced the establishment of an Action Fraud hotline  0300 123 2040 that will be linked to the National Fraud Agency&#39;s reporting centre. <br /><br />Fraud against one section of a council, such as tenancy fraud, is often linked to other types of fraud, so the three councils will pass on any leads to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) which is overseen by the City of London Police. <br /><br />This is the first time that local authorities will have used the Action Fraud hotline and the NFIB in this way. <br /> <br />Speaking at the launch, the Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell, said: &#34;Fraud is a crime that we are all increasingly exposed to. We in the public sector take the issue of fraud very seriously. Every penny stolen by fraudsters is a penny less that we can spend on front line services to protect the most vulnerable in our society. That is why I welcome the launch of this fraud awareness month to draw the public&#39;s attention to these issues, raise awareness among our own staff and to collectively share vital intelligence and information to help us to better prevent and detect fraud.&#34; <br /><br />Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Communities and Local Government, Baroness Hanham said: &#34;I am pleased that the councils are piloting the approaches recommended in the Government&#39;s Fighting Fraud Locally report, which sets out how to tackle the £2bn of local fraud through better detection and fraud recovery, as well as extending their help and experience in dealing with fraud, to social landlords. They cannot afford to have resources meant for vulnerable people being stolen by fraudsters. Fighting fraud will help local councils protect front line services as well as ensure Taxpayers&#39; hard-earned money is not wasted.&#34;<br /><br />The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has been working with registered housing providers  for some time and last year recovered more than 70 social housing properties, which amounts to ten per cent of the borough&#39;s annual housing allocations. <br /><br />In addition anti-fraud teams from the three councils have over the past two years, recovered more than 200 social housing properties, prosecuted 130 people for fraud, including the first for subletting a social tenancy, and uncovered benefit fraud worth more than £2 million.<br />   <br />Westminster City Council&#39;s antifraud tsar, Cllr Lindsey Hall, said: &#34;Whether the fraud relates to the illegal subletting of Social Housing or the abuse of Housing Benefit to fund tenancies in the private sector for subletting, fraudsters need to understand that the game is now up.  Where in the past they have been able to exploit the gaps in the system between Local Authorities, Housing Associations and Benefits&#39; agencies; we are now closing ranks and talking to each other thanks to this new partnership and enhanced data sharing.&#34;<br /><br />The month-long campaign will conclude with a special workshop on tenancy fraud for housing associations in the three boroughs.<br /><br />Over the next month, the councils will be trialling toolkits produced by the NFA to raise awareness of the work to combat fraud based on the central Government fraud awareness campaign `Spot it, Stop it&#39; and `Spot the Cheater&#39;, the toolkit will be eventually rolled out nationally.<br /><br />Deputy Leader of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council and Cabinet Member for Residents&#39; Services Cllr Greg Smith said:  &#34;We are always looking at new and innovative ways of tackling housing tenancy fraud and catching benefit cheats, who steal millions of pounds every year, direct from decent taxpayers&#39; pockets. As this hotline links up the councils and the National Fraud Agency from the beginning of any investigation, we are sharing information more easily, being efficient and giving ourselves more opportunities to catch criminals and fraudsters than ever.&#34; <br /><br />Peabody Director of Neighbourhoods, Joe Joseph said:  &#34;This partnership strengthens the already existing relationships between Peabody and the councils. This project will no doubt increase the detection of those that commit tenancy fraud and I hope make them feel less comfortable with their dishonesty.&#34; ","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL"," month-long fraud awareness campaign ","Peabody Housing Association","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Westminst","Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell",,"A new phase in the fight against fraud was announced (Thursday 8 November) when three leading London councils begin a month-long fraud awareness campaign to targets fraudsters in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham.","Councils lead new phase in fight against fraud"

We&#39;ve a really good teacher and spend 55 minutes exercising to music. She&#39;s very clever and gets us to exercise all our muscles,&#34; Dorothy explained.<br /><br />&#34;When I was young I did a lot of walking and also played tennis but you did not consciously exercise in those days,&#34; she added.<br /><br />She attributes her longevity to enjoying life.&#34; Apart from the tragedy of losing my husband I have had a very happy life. I gave up smoking with great difficulty at 73 because my second husband did not like it and asked me to stop.&#34;<br /><br />Dorothy&#39;s first husband John Symons died in the Second World War in 1944 just after her second daughter was born.  <br /><br />After her husband&#39;s death Dorothy lived in Battersea for nine years with her two young daughters before moving to Chelsea in 1954 where she still lives.  She has five grand children and eight great grand children.  She remarried when she was 66 years old but after eight and half years her second husband Noel Patrick died. <br /><br />&#34;I had an incredible birthday, the main celebration was a family event at the Cavalry and Guards Club. My actual birthday was on Sunday 28 October and I went to my church, St Mary in the Boltons, and unbeknown to me one of the great grandchildren tied a helium balloon to the back of my pew for everyone to see.&#34;<br /><br />In spite of turning 100, Dorothy continues to enjoy an active social life as well as going to her exercise classes at New Horizons. She enjoys attending the Christ Church Fellowship, listening to classical music, watching television and reading.<br /><br />Cllr Fiona Buxton, Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care, said: &#34;I wish Dorothy hearty congratulations on her 100th birthday. I&#39;m delighted that she is able to enjoy the activities offered by the New Horizons Centre.  Dorothy&#39;s is an example to us all and proof that you are never old to take up exercise.&#34;<br /><br />New Horizons Centre  Cadogon Street, SW3 is a multi activity centre offering varied weekly activities for those aged 50 and over.

This is another example of the groundbreaking initiative between the two boroughs to improve services through more cooperative working; rather than paying for a control room in each borough the two councils will consolidate their CCTV operations within one.<br /><br />High definition digital surveillance cameras, surpassing many used by professional photographers, now cover large parts of west London and the two local councils are now joining forces to create a fully integrated system. <br /><br />Using a combination of fixed and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, nearly 7million hours of footage a year, or 134,000 hours a week, will be streamed from the councils&#39; 798 cameras into the CCTV control room - which cost £80,000 to upgrade.<br /><br />Some of the high definition PTZ cameras can zoom hundreds of metres and come equipped with infrared night vision technology and even windscreen wipers to combat the elements.<br /><br />Live images can be beamed direct to command centres in police stations or downloaded at the touch of a button to be used in criminal investigations or as evidence.<br /><br />Inside the control room, ten 47 inch LED screens form a video wall that beams live images from around the two boroughs to a team of five operators who work around the clock to keep the boroughs safe. Council operators are poised to instantly respond to live situations and alert the police, or other appropriate authority, as events unfold. <br /><br />From high speed pursuits and violent assaults and other crimes in progress including people acting suspiciously, CCTV staff can track incidents as they are happening -increasing the chances that criminals will be caught red handed.<br /><br />Councillor Greg Smith, H&#38;F Council Deputy Leader, said: &#34;CCTV is a fantastic way to deter, catch and convict criminals. This new CCTV hub is the eyes and ears of law-abiding residents and we now have cameras covering every nook and cranny of our patch.

According to the National Cancer Intelligence Network some 840 Londoners are diagnosed each year with a brain, central nervous system or intracranial tumour. This type of cancer has one of the lowest survival rates of all cancers and is responsible for the most deaths from cancer for people aged under 40 years.  <br /><br />Cases are increasing by more than two per cent a year but less than two per cent of all cancer research goes to fund research into brain tumours. <br /><br />Cllr Buckmaster, who chose to support the BTRC after a close friend was diagnosed with a brain tumour, thanked concert-goers for their support. He said: &#34;all too often we hear of the most dreadful illnesses which strike suddenly and can prove to be life-threatening. The news is devastating for the individuals and those close to them. In their desperation all they want is a magic wand that can be waved to make the whole ghastly situation just go away.<br /><br />&#34;Sadly my appeal cannot be for a wand of that sort but with your help I am raising money for a type of wand - one that will be a significant help to neurosurgeons when they operate on brain tumours.&#34;<br /><br />The borough was the first to benefit from Sonowand technology neurosurgeon and BTRC co-founder Kevin O&#39;Neil told the audience. &#34;Since then we have discovered that its use can make surgery safer, more accurate and more complete.  This translates into patients living longer and this gives the patients more opportunity not just to live life but also reap the benefits from all the other research we are producing,&#34; he said.<br /><br />&#34;Brain tumours are not discerning when it comes to age, sex, colour, creed or class. They can affect anyone,&#34; he added.<br /><br />Among the readers at the concert was Alexandra Dixon who herself underwent surgery with a Sonowand machine in an operation performed by Mr O&#39;Neill in 2007.<br /><br />The concert is one of a number of events the Mayor is organising to raise funds. Other events planned for 2013 include Easter Fair on Wednesday 13 March at Kensington Town Hall, a dog show on Saturday April 13 and Mayor&#39;s Magic Wand Showtime Dinner in the Great Hall, Kensington Town Hall on Thursday 25 April.   <br /><br />To donate to the appeal or for more information on other events email mayor@rbkc.gov.uk or phone 020 7361 2431 or 020 7361 3659<br />One hundred per cent of all funds raised go to research with all the administration costs being absorbed by the Trustees and volunteers.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Mayor of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Christopher ","John Rutter ","Christmas Carol Concert ","Sonowand for Charing Cross Hospital ","Brain Tumour Research Campaign (BTRC).

Deputy Leader of the Royal Borough, Cllr Nick Paget Brown; Chair of London Food, Rosie Boycott and representatives from Capital Growth were on hand to help with the planting.<br /> <br />In addition to receiving ten fruit trees the St Charles garden was also awarded a £1,000 grant and a selection of horticultural tools.<br /><br />The project has transformed an underused courtyard into a green open space which allows 15 community groups to grow fruit and vegetables. The groups include Second Half Centre, Age UK, Baraka Youth, Dalgarno Neighbourhood Trust, St Charles School, Blenheim Project, Open Age, the Oremi Centre, St Charles Health and Wellbeing staff, WAND and Living Well. <br /><br />Cllr Nick Paget Brown said: &#34;I am sure that residents who use the St Charles Health and Wellbeing Centre will be delighted to be able to enjoy the 2,012th community kitchen garden. The Royal Borough has been working with local communities for many years to create community gardens, often in unusual or underused places, and they have proved to be very popular and a real community asset. I would like to thank Capital Growth for helping with this latest venture which will benefit 15 local groups. In addition to developing thriving vegetable plots, projects like this are also nurturing community links and a sense of neighbourliness.&#34;<br /><br />Rosie Boycott said: &#34;I want to say a huge thank you to London Food Link, our many sponsors and partners as well as all the wonderful volunteers who have rolled up their sleeves to transform forgotten, unloved spots across the city.

Together with money from other sources, the new fund could see as much as £1.5m invested in new organisations and projects over the next three years.<br /><br />Successful bidders to the fund have had to show how they are offering a new service, reaching a new client group or are themselves a new group not currently receiving a grant.  In particular, the Council selected proposals that address its own priorities of tackling social isolation, supporting people into work and training, and encouraging greater neighbourliness, civic participation and self-help.<br /><br />A critical component of all the successful bids was a business plan demonstrating how the service would in time become financially sustainable without Council money.<br /><br />Amongst the successful bids are ideas for:<br /><br /> a used furniture enterprise that would train unemployed people in upholstery and  furniture repairs so that donations can be brought back into use<br /><br /> two cafes to provide training and employment opportunities for local people, one of which would focus on those with a learning difficulty<br /><br /> a network of successful Royal Borough entrepreneurs to mentor local start up businesses <br /><br />  a volunteering and social networking scheme for the over 50s.<br /><br />  <br />Moreover, the organisations providing well-established services such as community centres, support to local groups and citizen&#39;s advice will continue to receive significant funding - some £1.99m in total next year.<br /><br />&#34;We have long supported voluntary sector organisations because we believe they are a fundamental part of a strong and healthy community,&#34; said Cabinet Member for Civil Society, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen.<br /><br />&#34;We knew that there was a lot of untapped creativity and entrepreneurialism in the local voluntary sector and we are delighted to be supporting some really exciting new projects and organisations.<br /><br />&#34;We are confident that together the existing and new organisations can play an even more important role in these tough financial times, ensuring that our local communities become stronger and more resilient.&#34; <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cllr Feilding mellen",,,,,"Money for the voluntary sector in Kensington and Chelsea is set to increase next year (2013/14), despite the continuing reductions in the Council&#39;s overall budget.","Civil society spending set to grow in Kensington and Chelsea"
"4302","11/01/2013 09:12:00","A BUDGET FOR EXCELLENT SERVICES","A draft budget entailing virtually no loss of service to residents was set out by the Cabinet last night (Thursday 10 January 2013), despite the continuing squeeze on local government spending.<br /><br />It will go to a further Cabinet meeting in February before being submitted to the full Council for debate and final approval on Wednesday 6 March.<br /> <br />The Government grant for Kensington and Chelsea will fall by £8.5 million or 6.7 per cent in 2013-14.  Reductions in grant will have caused a 14 per cent reduction in the Council&#39;s recurrent spending between 2010-11 and 2013-14 after allowing for inflation. (i) <br /><br />Despite these reductions, the draft budget proposes no increase in Council Tax to fill the funding gap.  Council Tax will be frozen for the fourth year in a row, helped in part by a grant of £700,000 from the Government, equivalent to a one per cent rise.  The Royal Borough&#39;s Council Tax will therefore remain one of the very lowest in England. (ii)  <br /><br />Rather than any increase in local tax, the budget proposes instead to find £9.5 million of savings through further service efficiencies.<br /><br />A key element of that programme is the sharing of a range of major services with our Tri-borough partners, Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham.(iii)   Sharing management, back office functions and procurement is on track to deliver at least £10m worth of savings a year by 2014-15.<br /><br />But other policies and initiatives would also contribute.  The Council is lowering costs by moving more transactions online.  It is consolidating staff into fewer buildings to reduce overheads and so that the unused capacity can be released for sale or rent.  In addition pay per officer is now about 5.5 per cent lower than it was in 2008.<br /><br />These savings and efficiencies have enabled the Council to avoid any significant service reduction.<br /><br />Despite the continuing financial pressures, strong reserves built up over many years will enable the Council to continue to be ambitious for the Royal Borough in 2013.  For example, work will be getting underway on the new £60 million Academy and leisure centre for North Kensington; two thirds of which will be met directly from the Council&#39;s own coffers.  There are also exciting plans for a new Middle Row primary school, a new children&#39;s home at East Row and a major regeneration scheme for the Westway area.(iv) <br /><br />&#34;Our strategy is seeing us through these difficult times while maintaining excellent local services,&#34;* (v) said the Leader of the Council, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell.<br />&#34;We are proud to be at the forefront of revolutionary change in local government and we are equally proud that we are still able to pursue our ambitions to regenerate our borough and provide it with the new schools, new homes and new community facilities that it needs.&#34;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cabinet","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea","council Tax"," Council Tax will be frozen ",,"A draft budget entailing virtually no loss of service to residents was set out by the Cabinet last night (Thursday 10 January 2013), despite the continuing squeeze on local government spending.","A budget for excellent services"

There is a chance to take to the water with sailing, kayaking, diving, swimming and rowing.  The more combative can take on the challenge of fencing and judo while those who like their sport to demand pinpoint accuracy can give archery a try.  <br /> <br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;This is an opportunity to get involved in some exciting and competitive sports and perhaps go on to represent the borough at the London Youth Games.

"4318","06/02/2013 11:26:00","COUNCIL CONSULTS ON PROPOSED COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE LEVY CHARGES","The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is consulting with residents on the rate of Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) that it proposes setting for certain kinds of developments, notably new residential developments, hotels and student accommodation. <br /><br />CIL is used to raise money to help fund community resources and facilities for example schools or health centres. It can also support existing facilities such as parks and public transport. The rationale for this is that developments that expand the borough&#39;s permanent or temporary resident population will place greater pressure on such facilities and should therefore contribute towards their upkeep or extension.<br /><br />CIL is collected through the planning process. In the past this type of support came through Section 106 (s106) agreements which were negotiated on a development-by-development basis. S106 agreements will continue in use but on a limited basis to deal with site specific requirements, for example affordable housing.<br /><br />However, unlike s106, CIL is a mandatory tariff. <br /><br />For housing CIL will be charged on all new floor space above 100 square metres. This means that modest house extensions will not incur a charge as they will be below this threshold. It will also be charged on all the floor space of new houses or flats, even where they are less than 100 square metres. A space of 100 square metres is generally large enough to accommodate an ample three or four bedroom flat, or two smaller flats.<br /><br />The charge on housing will vary across the borough. It is proposed to split the borough into six zones, based on post-code boundaries. The rates range from £100 per square metre to £650 per square metre. <br /><br />The two upper charging zones are Zone A and Zone B which cover 45 per cent of the borough. Zone A is Knightsbridge where the proposed charge is £650 per square metre.  Zone B covers Chelsea and Holland Park and the charge is £500 per square metre).  <br /><br />Zone C, Kensington High Street and Notting Hill, will be charged at £370 per square metre. Together with Zone D, Earl&#39;s Court, (£230 per square metre) the two mid range zones cover almost 30 per cent of the borough.<br /><br />The lower range zones, Olympia and north of the Westway, Zones E and F account for the remaining 25 per cent of the borough, and their rates are £150 and £100 per square metre respectively. <br /><br />In addition to residential developments, the Council also proposes charging CIL on new hotels and student accommodation which are in excess of 100 square metres. These developments will be charged at a borough-wide rate of £160 per square metre for hotels and £125 per square metre for student accommodation. <br /><br />The Council does not propose charging for other commercial developments such as offices, warehouses, retail developments, health care, leisure facilities and schools.  Social housing and charitable developments are exempt from CIL. <br /><br />Before deciding on the rates/charges the Council commissioned a viability study by BNP Paribas. A key consideration was that the proposed charges would not harm the economic viability of development in the borough. The rate must not be set so high as to prevent development.  <br /><br />CIL is expected to raise about £2 million a year, but could raise more depending on the level of development. This is about the same as the sums collected through s106 contributions. <br /><br />Consultation on the CIL Preliminary Draft Charging Schedule has started and will run until Wednesday 20 February 2013.  There will be further consultation in July before the proposals are submitted to an Independent Examination in the autumn. The full charging system will be adopted and operational in 2014.<br /><br />Last April the Mayor of London introduced a Mayoral CIL of £50 per square metre for most developments which is intended to collect funds towards Crossrail. The borough&#39;s CIL will be paid in addition to that which the Mayor is charging. The Mayor&#39;s CIL applies to developments for retail or commercial purposes which are excluded from the Council&#39;s proposals, as well as residential uses which are covered by the borough&#39;s charges.<br /><br />To see the full Cabinet Report, please go to www.rbkc.gov.uk/cabinet/cil<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Community Infrastructure Levy ","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea"," s106","Residential development, hotels, student accomodat",,"The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is consulting with residents on the rate of Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) that it proposes setting for certain kinds of developments, notably new residential developments, hotels and student accommodation.

Councillors and residents agree on the projects to support.  <br /><br />In the north of the borough St Charles ward councillors decided to dedicate about half of its City Living, Local Life budget for at least two years to provide life coaching for local residents. Match funding was secured from two local organisations. The project will be managed by a local community centre. Based on a successful scheme that had been tested a few years earlier, the aim is to eventually have locally trained residents working as life coaches in the area and helping others. <br /><br />In nearby Golborne ward an outreach project provided support and training to help local residents get back into work.<br /><br />In Brompton Ward, in the south of the borough, councillors and residents oversaw the development of an online register to allow local people to see if businesses have permission to place tables and chairs on pavements and report breaches to the Council.<br /><br />In Abingdon ward, which includes Kensington High Street, almost 1,800 neighbours and friends turned out to enjoy a Diamond Jubilee Street party which included a fashion show displaying original debutantes&#39; evening dresses from the fifties.<br /><br />Cabinet Member for Civil Society, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen, said: &#34;Kensington and Chelsea has a history of civic involvement and City Living, Local Life is building on this tradition. <br /><br />&#34;It is bringing residents, councillors and community leaders together to identify local issues and deliver practical solutions which are making a difference in neighbourhoods across the borough.

Ten years ago six out of ten residents believed the Council should campaign for a station in Chelsea, large parts of which are some distance from a Tube station. <br /><br />The rail scheme has been dormant for several years but is now firmly back on the radar following the publication of a prospective route by the business group London First.<br /><br />London First say that by the late 2020s there will be a critical need for new rail capacity in central, south-west and north-east London, even after the completion of Crossrail, Thameslink and the current Tube upgrades.<br /><br />Planning how to meet that need must start now and the best way to do so is a second `Crossrail&#39; line connecting these parts of London. <br /><br />The idea for Crossrail 2 - or the Chelsea-Hackney Line as it has traditionally been called - has actually been around for decades. And the Council has been a keen supporter of the idea and a station on the King&#39;s Road for almost as long.<br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;It is clear that London&#39;s growing population will need new public transport routes to prevent overloading of the existing system.<br /><br />&#34;For many years we&#39;ve been convinced that a station in Chelsea, on the Chelsea-Hackney Line, will bring great benefit to the borough.  Of course, with the publication of this proposed Crossrail 2 route featuring a station on the King&#39;s Road, we will want to hear again what our residents and businesses think and plan to take every opportunity to consult with them.<br /><br />&#34;As well as being a real boost to London and local economy a station on the King&#39;s Road would provide alternatives to the car and bring environmental benefits.&#34;<br /><br />The line, which would run from Surrey to Hertfordshire, would link Chelsea to Clapham Junction, the West End and four of central London&#39;s busiest mainline stations. <br /><br />The route, safeguarded for the Chelsea-Hackney Line back in 1991, includes a station on the King&#39;s Road and Council support for the scheme is based on the need to relieve congestion in the Chelsea area and provide residents with easier access to the West End and City.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL",,,,,,"News that the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, is supporting the Crossrail 2 route put forward by London First has been warmly welcomed by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

The festival is expected to give a major boost to the number of active cyclists in the UK, while attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors to London and Surrey.<br /><br />On Sunday 4 August the mass participation Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 and the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic race for professional male cyclists will start in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The routes, which will come through Kensington and Chelsea will pass many of London&#39;s iconic landmarks, before passing through Richmond Park and out into the stunning Surrey Hills - including the testing climbs of Box Hill and Leith Hill - and then returning to finish in the heart of the capital in true Olympic style on the Mall,<br /><br />While both the Prudential RideLondon Surrey 100 and the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic will be spectacular and exciting events the road closures that will accompany them will cause severe disruption to roads and public transport will also be affected in the borough and across large parts of London and Surrey.<br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Council, said: &#34;These cycling events are a fitting legacy of last summer&#39;s wonderful Olympic Games.  I am sure the efforts of both the amateur and professional cyclists will be appreciated by large crowds not only here in the Royal Borough but right across London and Surrey.<br /><br />&#34;Of course, staging such massive events will inevitably cause disruption with road closures and changes to bus routes.  We will work with TfL to minimise this but also urge residents to familiarise themselves with the route and plan ahead.&#34;<br /><br />The route enters the borough in Knightsbridge and travels along the route of the A4 before entering Hammersmith and Fulham.  Cyclists will then come back into the borough via King&#39;s Road, Edith Grove and Chelsea Embankment before an exciting finish on the Mall.<br /><br />A map of the entire route can be found on www.PrudentialRideLondon.co.uk<br /><br />The length of road closures will depend on the location of the road on the event route.  The organisers want to minimise the disruption to local residents and therefore will be working hard to ensure the roads are only closed for as long as absolutely necessary.  The organisers of the event will be communicating with local residents and businesses on the route to inform them of closure times and more information will be published on www.PrudentialRideLondon.co.uk<br /><br />The Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 to be held on Sunday 4 August is open to amateur and club riders.

"4330","18/02/2013 15:46:00","A NEW DIRECTION FOR OLDER PEOPLE'S HOUSING ","Housing and care home options in Kensington and Chelsea are the subject of a major consultation launched today (Monday 18 February 2013).<br /><br />By 2030, the number of over 65s in the Royal Borough is expected to grow by 29 per cent, the number of over 85s by 69 per cent.   In addition there will be a doubling of the number of people with dementia, from around 1,000 now, to over 2,000.<br /><br />In response, the Royal Borough has developed a draft strategy for meeting the future housing and care needs of this fast growing demographic.  But it now wants to hear the views of local residents, voluntary organisations, medical and social care professionals and housing landlords.<br /><br />The national understanding of how to achieve the best outcomes for older people has been evolving in recent years and there is now a compelling body of evidence that being in the right kind of housing produces more years of good health and independence, a lower probability of hospital admission, and a lower number of falls. <br /><br />Making sure that at all stages of the ageing process, the Royal Borough&#39;s older residents have access to the right kinds of accommodation is the challenge the strategy &#39;Modernising Older People&#39;s Housing and Accommodation with Care Services&#39; tries to address.  <br /><br />It makes seven key proposals:<br /><br /> Build new sheltered housing, where people have their own flats, but there is a trained manager onsite. This is for those who can live independently, with or without some support from homecare agencies.<br /><br /> Build new extra care housing which is similar to sheltered housing but with care staff on site 24 hours a day in addition to the manager. This is for those who need regular care throughout the day.<br /><br /> Work with developers so older people have a choice of renting from the Council, housing associations, private landlords or buying a home, either outright or in part.<br /><br /> Pay for the right amount of accommodation in good quality care homes and nursing homes so that those who can&#39;t remain at home have a place that meets modern standards and expectations.<br /><br /> Better support people coming out of hospital or who need help to regain independent living skills so they can return home sooner. With the NHS, focus our rehabilitation beds and therapists in one centre of excellence rather than have them dispersed across the borough.<br /><br /> Free up under-occupied family homes, by giving older people the option of moving to a more suitable, accessible home.<br /><br /> Develop an older people&#39;s &#34;community hub&#34; to provide day activities and help people to access other community services.<br /><br /><br />Commenting on the strategy and consultation, Cllr Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Housing, said:<br /><br />&#34;Our older people&#39;s housing waiting list  is growing fast and right now the mix of facilities we offer is far from the perfect fit with modern standards and aspirations.  Fixing that won&#39;t be easy, especially at a time when money is so short, but it has to be done and we would like to test our strategy for doing so with as many residents and professionals as possible. I do hope they will take this chance to get involved.&#34;<br /><br />You can read more about the strategy and complete a consultation questionnaire online at www.rbkc.gov.uk/housing.

The initiative is being formally launched today (Wednesday 6 March 2013).<br /><br />The Council has successfully bid for a European Commission grant of £317,693 and is also contributing £52,000 from its Community Safety Partnership funds towards the scheme.  <br /><br />The Royal Borough is the lead organisation for the initiative which will see the funding distributed to the Metropolitan Police&#39;s trafficking unit and partner agencies operating in Kensington and Chelsea, City of Westminster, Perugia (Italy) and Kaunas (Lithuania).  These specialists will raise awareness and skills for resisting traffickers amongst vulnerable groups and also provide victim support services to prevent re-trafficking.<br /><br />Data from the UK Human Trafficking Centre found that in 2011 there were 2,077 potential victims of human trafficking in the UK. <br /><br />In 2012 the Metropolitan Police Trafficked Victims Unit dealt with 147 victims and undertook 91 operations.  A recent investigation into a Russian and European-based organised criminal network resulted in the rescue of thirteen young, vulnerable Eastern European victims from premises in Kensington, Chelsea and Queensway.<br /><br />Lithuania has been identified by the police as a source location for trafficked victims in the United Kingdom.  Many vulnerable young women from care institutions are tricked, coerced or forced to leave to work in the sex industry.  Italy is both a destination country for trafficking victims and a transit country for co-ordination and onward trafficking of victims from Eastern Europe and Africa.<br /><br />As human trafficking is a transnational issue, the project will also work with all EU embassies located within Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster in order to improve consular support to victims and prevent the re-trafficking of repatriated victims back to the UK or elsewhere in the EU. <br /><br />Councillor Rock Feilding-Mellen, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Civil Society, said:<br /><br />&#34;Human trafficking is a terrible and complex crime so resources need to be given to help those agencies that have proven experience of tackling the issue.<br /><br />&#34;This two-year programme funds specialist anti-trafficking police officers and charities to tackle this issue at source and equip those vulnerable of being trafficked with the skills to resist, as well as giving victims the support they need to escape this cycle of abuse.&#34;<br /><br />Westminster City Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Protection and Premises, Councillor Nickie Aiken, said:<br /><br />&#34;The trafficking of vulnerable people across Europe is a repugnant crime that too often goes undetected in large cities. This programme aims to get to the root of the matter and harness expert officers to stamp out the practice, while also offering much-needed support to survivors of trafficking.&#34;<br /><br />Bex Keer, Team Manager for Stop the Traffik, stated:<br /><br />&#34;Stop the Traffik is committed to exploring a pioneering multi-agency approach to tackling trafficking through this initiative.  It is rare to have the opportunity to invest in a 360 degree response that includes prevention, intervention and aftercare of survivors.&#34;<br /><br />This project began in January 2013 and will run for 24 months.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Royal Borough ","human trafficking ","European Commission grant","Cllr Rock Fielding Mellen","Stop the Traffik ","A two-year programme to help stamp out human trafficking both here in the capital and abroad, has been announced by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

The project puts 16 to 18 year olds in the borough&#39;s schools in touch with older people to help them get connected and get online. <br /><br />The Minister stepped into the shoes of a student for the session and found out what it takes to bring someone up to speed with today&#39;s technology. Nick Hurd is volunteering through Age UK London in fulfilment of a pledge he made as part of ITV&#39;s Text Santa Appeal. The Government donated £1 to match every volunteering pledge to highlight the difference volunteering can make to people&#39;s lives.  <br /><br />While at the school Nick Hurd taught older learner Rosalin Harrison and was assisted by young volunteer Ena Buljko. <br /><br />Commenting upon his experience Nick Hurd said: &#34;The internet and the ability to use a computer and get online is just such a huge opportunity, but older people often need a lot of help. No one is better placed to offer that than young people who can do this stuff in their sleep. It&#39;s a really nice opportunity for young people to get to know older people and share some skills, feel valued for that and even in just half an hour. Rosalin has found about Google and opened up that whole world. It&#39;s just fantastic. Very simple and really good.&#39;&#39;<br /><br />Age UK Kensington and Chelsea member Rosalin Harrison said &#34;Nick Hurd taught me today. He knew his stuff and was very interesting. He certainly made his contribution to the session. My young volunteer Ena has great patience. She is charming and has all you need from a one-to-one instructor. As soon as I have my own computer I&#39;ll be able to improve my abilities. It is a wonderful project. Age UK Kensington and Chelsea have set up an excellent project.&#34;<br /><br />Ena Buljko, of Holland Park School, said &#34;I have been partnered with Rosalin and I really feel that I have a connection with her. I look forward to seeing her each week and enjoy our conversations. I feel that the things I teach her will be useful and hope that she manages to remember them all when she gets home. This week we had the honour of being joined by Nick Hurd, I think he did a good job with Rosaline - he was very funny and he was really patient with her, I think he did well!&#34;<br /><br />Colin Hall, Head of Holland Park School, said &#34;The project is a wonderful way of the elderly having direct contact with young people in situations where they can see their skills and it is an equally invaluable experience for young people to recognise the privileges they have of living in the technological twenty-first century.&#34;<br /><br />As well as Holland Park School, students from St Charles Sixth Form College and Paddington Academy have also joined forces with Age UK Kensington and Chelsea through the project. <br /><br />For more information contact Ben Long, Intergenerational Project Worker at Age UK Kensington and Chelsea on 020 8969 9105.

Actual spending by the Council will have dropped by 14 per cent between 2010-11 and 2013-14 after allowing for inflation.<br /><br />Even so, Council Tax will remain frozen at 2009-10 levels. And the Royal Borough&#39;s Council Tax will continue as one of the very lowest in England. The Council also retains its AAA credit rating from Standard &#38; Poor&#39;s.<br /><br />Rather than rely on increases in local tax or sharp reductions in services to plug the funding gap, the budget proposes instead to find £10 million of savings through further service efficiencies.<br /><br />A key element of that efficiency programme is the sharing of a range of major services with our Tri-borough partners, Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham.(iii) Sharing management, back office functions and procurement across the three boroughs is on track to deliver at least £13m worth of savings a year to Kensington and Chelsea by 2014-15.<br /><br />But other policies and initiatives would also contribute. The Council is lowering costs by moving more transactions online. It is consolidating staff into fewer buildings to reduce overheads and so that the unused capacity can be released for sale or rent. In addition pay per officer is now about 5.5 per cent lower than it was in 2008.<br /><br />These savings and efficiencies have enabled the Council to avoid any significant service reduction comparing 2012-13 and 2013-14.<br /><br />Despite the continuing financial pressures, strong reserves carefully built up over many years will allow the Council to continue to be ambitious for the Royal Borough in 2013. For example, work is already underway on the new £60 million academy and leisure centre for North Kensington; two thirds of which will be met directly from the Council&#39;s own coffers. There are also exciting plans for a new Middle Row primary school, a new children&#39;s home at East Row and a major regeneration scheme for the Westway area.(iv) <br /><br />&#34;Our strategy is seeing us through these difficult times while maintaining excellent local services,&#34; (v) said the Leader of the Council, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell.<br /><br />&#34;We are proud of that and equally proud that we are still able to pursue our ambitions to regenerate our borough and provide it with the new schools, new homes and new community facilities that it needs.&#34;","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","budget","Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell ","council Tax","cabinet","Govenrment grant ","A budget entailing no increase in Council Tax and no significant loss of valued services to residents was set by the Cabinet last night (21 February 2013), despite further reductions in local government funding.","A budget for keeping taxes stable and services excellent"

You can&#39;t judge hygiene by appearance alone which is why the Food Standards Agency (FSA), in partnership with councils throughout the country, has introduced the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS). Think of it as a way to see inside the restaurant kitchens and get some `behind the scenes&#39; information. <br /><br />Local restaurants, pubs, hotels, cafés, takeaways and other places that sell or serve food are given a food hygiene rating from 0 to 5 when they are inspected by a food safety officer from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The top rating of 5 means a business has `very good&#39; hygiene standards and every outlet should be able to reach this. <br /><br />It&#39;s easy to check out the ratings by looking them up online at www.food.gov.uk/ratings or by downloading the free `food hygiene&#39; app. You can also look out for the distinctive green and black stickers that businesses are encouraged to display to tell their customers the rating they were given. <br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Environmental Health said: &#34;When dining out, especially with loved ones, you&#39;ll choose to go to a place where you like the food and you know you&#39;ll have a good time. It also makes sense to check out the food hygiene rating as well. You might be surprised by some of the results. It&#39;s possible that a cheap takeaway might have a higher food hygiene rating than a smart, expensive restaurant.&#34;<br /><br />Catriona Stewart, Head of the Food Hygiene Ratings Team at the FSA, added: &#34;The FHRS is all about putting the consumer first, giving people useful information on which to base their choice of where to eat. The FSA is working in partnership with Kensington and Chelsea and other local authorities to roll out this scheme nationally. We recommend that when you eat out you choose the places with the higher ratings.&#34;<br /><br />There are estimated to be around a million cases of food poisoning every year in the UK, with about 20,000 people ending up in hospital.

Actual spending by the Council will have dropped by 14 per cent between 2010-11 and 2013-14 after allowing for inflation.<br /> <br />Even so, Council Tax will remain frozen at 2009-10 levels. And the Royal Borough&#39;s Council Tax will continue to be one of the very lowest in England. <br /> <br />Rather than rely on increases in local tax or sharp reductions in services to plug the funding gap, the budget will instead find £10 million of savings through further service efficiencies. The Council has also found savings to offset an increase in charges by the Western Riverside Waste Authority, rather than passing on the increase to residents through an increase in the total Council Tax they pay.<br /> <br />A key element of that efficiency programme is the sharing of a range of major services with our Tri-borough partners, Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham. Sharing management, back office functions and procurement across the three boroughs is on track to deliver at least £13m worth of savings a year to Kensington and Chelsea by 2014-15.<br /> <br />But other policies and initiatives will also contribute. The Council is lowering costs by moving more transactions online. It is consolidating staff into fewer buildings to reduce overheads and so that the unused capacity can be released for sale or rent. In addition pay per officer is now about 5.5 per cent lower than it was in 2008 in real terms.<br /> <br />These savings and efficiencies have enabled the Council to avoid any significant service reduction comparing 2012-13 and 2013-14.<br /> <br />Despite the continuing financial pressures, strong reserves carefully built up over many years will allow the Council to continue to be ambitious for the Royal Borough in 2013. For example, work is already underway on the new £60 million academy and leisure centre for North Kensington; two thirds of which will be met directly from the Council&#39;s own coffers. There are also exciting plans for a new Middle Row primary school, a new children&#39;s home at East Row and a major regeneration scheme for the Westway area. <br /> <br />&#34;Our strategy is seeing us through these difficult times while maintaining excellent local services,&#34; said the Leader of the Council, Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell.<br /> <br />&#34;We are proud of that and equally proud that we are still able to pursue our ambitions to regenerate our borough and provide it with the new schools, new homes and new community facilities that it needs.&#34;<br /> ","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Council Tax","Leader Cockell  ","Royal borough of kensingtion and chelsea "," Budget","Frontline services","A budget entailing no increase in Council Tax and no significant loss of valued services to residents was passed at last night&#39;s Council Meeting (Wednesday 6 March).","Budget protects services and freezes Council Tax"

They include measures that will transform not only who can get a Council home, but also on what terms.  <br /><br />Amongst the key proposals is an end to lifetime tenancies.  All future tenants would be issued with a 12 month introductory tenancy.  Providing its terms aren&#39;t broken, they would then be eligible for either a two, or more typically, a five year tenancy.<br /><br />Tenancies would not be renewed if at the end of their term:<br /><br /> the property has become too large for the household&#39;s needs<br /> household income has grown to more than £50,000 for one and two bed flats and £65,000 for larger properties<br /> savings and investments other than for pension purposes exceed £25,000<br /> the tenant or tenant&#39;s partner has acquired a legal interest in another property suitable for occupation<br /> there has been a serious breach of the tenancy agreement including rent arrears or antisocial behaviour.<br /><br />As well as tightening the terms of tenancies, the Council also proposes to tighten the rules on which households qualify for Council and Housing Association homes.  If adopted, the new allocations policy would generally rule out people who have not been in the borough for at least three years.  People with high incomes and significant savings would not make the list either.<br /><br />However, extra points would be awarded to households where at least one member is in paid work for 16 hours a week or more.  Serving and former members of the armed forces and bereaved partners of forces personnel would also attract extra points.<br /><br />&#34;Our existing tenancy and allocation policies belong to a time when councils were able to build new homes and the turnover of the existing stock was far higher,&#34; said Cllr Tim Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Housing.  &#34;We now need to make sure that this scarce and precious resource goes only to the right people.  For us that means those in the greatest need, those with real roots in our borough, those who work and contribute, and those who have served our country.  That is what these proposals are all about.  <br /><br />&#34;We now want to hear what our residents and the wider public have to say.&#34; <br /><br />Should the new policies be adopted, the Council intends to remove from its housing register those households with such low priority that they have no realistic prospect of ever getting a Council or Housing Association home.  Last year the Council let 550 properties but it has nearly 9,000 households on its housing register, nearly 6,500 of which are neither homeless, chronically overcrowded or in pressing medical need and therefore have little hope of being offered a social housing tenancy. <br /><br />&#34;A lot of people are currently able to join our housing register who in fact have very low priority and therefore very few housing points or often no housing points at all,&#34; explained Cllr Coleridge.  <br /><br /> &#34;It is better to offer people realistic housing advice as to where they can find suitable accommodation than to give out totally unrealistic expectations that leads to many people waiting years for an offer that will simply not happen.&#34; <br /><br />Subject to the Cabinet&#39;s decision, public consultation on the new policies gets under way on 1 April 2013 and will conclude on 25 June 2013.  The Cabinet will then make a final decision on adoption in late summer 2013.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Housing","cllr coleridge","reform ","tenancies ","Localism ","Armed forces personnel and people with genuine local connections will receive greater priority for council housing as part of a package of sweeping reforms to new tenancies in Kensington and Chelsea.","Sweeping reforms to new tenancies in Kensington and Chelsea"

The Mayor&#39;s Vision for Cycling in London report described the scheme as &#34;brilliantly led&#34;. <br /><br />These changes have been designed to make cycling more attractive and allow riders to take the most direct route to their destination, as well as preventing situations in which one-way streets force cyclists onto busier main roads. The streets now have `Except cycles&#39; signs below the existing `No Entry&#39; signs together with signs and markings warning drivers that cyclists are allowed to travel in the opposite direction. This was only possible after the Council persuaded the Department for Transport to allow it to use this intuitive and simple arrangement of signs, which was previously not permitted. All councils are now able to use this arrangement. <br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Transport, said: <br /><br />&#34;We are delighted to be recognised for our pioneering cycling scheme with this London Transport Award.

Over 50 stall holders took part featuring a range of goodies from handmade china, to cold meats, to fashion and household accessories. <br /><br />Specialist auctioneers Dreweatts Auction Houses, seen here examining the Mayor&#39;s chain of office, were on hand to provide a valuation of jewellery and small antique items for fair goers.<br /><br />As well as raising funds for Brain Tumour Research Campaign the Mayor is working to help buy a SonoWand for neurosurgeons at Charing Cross Hospital. The SonoWand makes surgery safer, more accurate and more complete and this results in patients living longer and having more opportunity to enjoy their family and friends while also benefiting from the BTRC research.<br /><br />Charing Cross Hospital is one of only two units in the country with a Sonowand. But demand is growing and it desperately needs another upgraded version.  Recent figures from the National Cancer Intelligence Network show that the North West London area, which comprises the Charing Cross Hospital, has the best results in the UK for one, three and five year survival rates for brain cancer.<br /><br />If you would like to help the Mayor&#39;s Charity email mayor@rbkc.gov.uk or to donate go to http://www.wayahead-btrc.org/news-events/charity-of-the-year/","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Brain Tumour Research Campaign ","Royal Borough&#39;s Mayor Cllr Buckmaster","Mr Michael Portillo ","SonoWand for neurosurgeons at Charing Cross Hospit",,"Easter came early to Kensington Town Hall last week (Wednesday 13 March) when the Easter Fair raised over £10,000 for the Brain Tumour Research Campaign (BTRC) the official charity of Royal Borough&#39;s Mayor Cllr Buckmaster.","Easter Fair raises over £10,000 for Mayor&#39;s cancer charity"

Designed to introduce a sense of proportionality to basement proposals, the draft policies include:<br /><br />a reduction in the extent basements can intrude into the garden, from 85 per cent to 50 per cent, with that 50 per cent being a single area of space.<br /><br />a restriction to a single storey in most cases, with exceptions only being considered for large comprehensive developments.<br /><br />an outright ban on basement developments under, or in the gardens, of listed buildings or where basements already exist, though again exceptions might be considered on very large sites.<br /><br />the compulsory installation of pumps to prevent flooding from sewers. <br /><br />The move follows a study by the leading engineering consultancy, Alan Baxter and Associates, into the impact of multiple basement developments on the built and natural environment in Kensington and Chelsea.  <br /><br />Commenting on the new draft policies inspired by that report, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, Cllr Tim Ahern, said:<br /><br />&#34;We do not argue for a ban on basement development, only for a better balance between them and the amenity of our other residents.  If the cumulative impact of scores of schemes that take months and years to complete is to damage the wider quality of life in our borough I believe we have a right to take that into account.<br /><br />&#34;Just as important, we want to preserve our garden space in its green, leafy and flowering form.  In particular we want trees to grow and thrive and they simply can&#39;t do that in thin soil that&#39;s principal purpose is to cover over a dwelling space.<br /><br />&#34;We also need to retain our soak away areas and for that you need space wide enough and deep enough.  Basements that are storeys deep do not help.  <br /><br />&#34;Finally, Kensington and Chelsea is an important heritage area with thousands of listed buildings.  Increasingly it&#39;s clear that major basement developments can be structurally very challenging.  Because of that increased risk to the fabric of our precious heritage assets we believe we should adopt the precautionary principle and reduce the risk by limiting the scale of some of the developments we have been seeing here.<br /><br />&#34;But now it&#39;s time for the public and the professionals to have their say.  We will listen carefully and our proposals will be examined by an Independent Inspector later in the year, after which we will take a final decision.&#34;<br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","basements ","Planning   ","Reduction in size ","cllr ahern ","consultation ","Stricter planning rules could spell the end of mega-basements in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.","Council calls time on iceberg houses"

There was evidence of gnawed packets of rice and uncooked prawn crackers and mouse droppings were found on food contact surfaces. <br /><br />The restaurant was not kept clean, there was a failure to provide hot and cold running water and there had been a failure to keep stored foodstuffs protected from contamination.  It therefore posed a risk to public health and was immediately closed.<br /><br />Mr Leo Jubbang, the Director of Café De Thai Limited, pleaded guilty to four food hygiene offences and was fined £3,000. In addition he was ordered to pay the Council&#39;s £2,000 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. <br /><br />Mr Jubbang told the court that he had only been trading since 2009 and that his business had been suffering due to the current financial climate. In sentencing the magistrates took account of the economic downturn in fining him but also noted that the conditions found at the premises were disgusting.<br /><br />Councillor Fiona Buxton, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: <br /><br />&#34;When officers visited this restaurant they found a serious mouse infestation and shut the premises immediately.  I am relieved that the court has handed down this substantial fine and hope it sends a clear signal that unhygienic conditions will not be tolerated in the borough.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cafe de thai ","23 All Saints Road","Mice droppings","Fined  ","Cllr buxton ","A restaurant in All Saints Road is counting the cost of falling foul of food hygiene standards after being ordered to pay £5,015 yesterday (Tuesday 19 March 2013) at West London Magistrates&#39; Court.

These buyers are able to invest huge sums of money in very large residential units over 350 sq m sometimes known as `super-prime&#39;.(1) The Council now proposes to restrict the size of very large residential units in a scheme to 25 per cent of the overall floor space.  <br /><br />There will also be restrictions on creating very large units by amalgamating existing properties, except where this restores a house to a single unit, which had been previously split into flats.<br /><br />These restrictions closely follow the Council&#39;s recent move to set limits on the scale of basement development in the borough.  Highlights of these new policies include a reduction in the extent which basements can extend into the garden, a restriction to a single storey and an outright ban on basement developments under, or in the gardens, of listed buildings, or where a basement already exists.(2)<br /><br />Measures to encourage an increase in the number of affordable homes being built in the borough include raising the threshold where affordable housing should be built on site to 2,400 sq m.  By doubling the threshold, the Council believes it will be more realistic for developers to build affordable homes as part of new developments instead of off-site.  <br /><br />Other changes require developers to make a financial contribution towards affordable housing on all schemes below the 2,400 sq m threshold.  This will be charged per square metre and on the entire floor space with the removal of the previous 800 sq m `tax free&#39; element.  <br /><br />Councillor Tim Ahern, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said:<br /><br />&#34;Property in Kensington and Chelsea has long been attractive to foreign investors and while we do not want to discourage international investment we want to restrict the proliferation of `super-prime&#39; properties to ensure there remains a balance in property sizes.<br /> <br />&#34;Having some of the most expensive land values in the country means it is a constant challenge for us to build affordable homes in the Royal Borough.  <br /><br />&#34;We believe that by raising the threshold for affordable housing to be built on site, combined with an increase in financial contributions from developers, we can achieve a meaningful increase in the number of affordable homes we deliver.&#34;<br /><br />The Council is consulting on its housing and basement policies for six weeks from Thursday 21 March 2013.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","super-prime","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea ","Large residential units ","Affordable homes  ","cllr tim ahern","Planning guidelines to help limit the size of `super-prime&#39; residential properties and encourage an increase in the number of affordable homes have been announced by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.","Guidelines announced to limit size of &#39;super-prime&#39; properties and encourage increase in affordable homes"

Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killers of children and adults under 40 and have the lowest survival rate of all cancers.<br /><br />So far Cllr Buckmaster has raised over £100,000 which will go towards buying a ground breaking surgical tool called the SonoWand for Charing Cross Hospital. The SonoWand  creates a virtual reconstruction of the brain enabling surgeons to operated more accurately. The hospital already has a SonoWand  but demand is growing and it desperately needs another upgraded version.  <br /><br />Estimates from the National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) indicate that approximately 840 Londoners are diagnosed with a brain, central nervous system or intracranial tumour each year and currently over 2,500 people are treated in London hospitals for tumours relating to the brain or central nervous system.

This will be achieved by dividing the station and bridge to a paying side and a free side. A fence will segregate the pedestrian route and an additional fourth staircase will be constructed to avoid congestion on the existing single staircase at the Olympia Way side of the station. This measure will keep the free and paying sides completely separate and the platforms will be inaccessible from this segregated pedestrian route.<br /><br />Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;This is very good news.  TfL has listened to our concerns and its decision to preserve pedestrian access over the footbridge at Olympia is to be welcomed.  Residents and Councillors from both sides of the bridge have campaigned hard to preserve the status quo and will be delighted that this long- established route will not be blocked by ticket gates.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL",,,,,,"Residents and Councillors have welcomed TfL&#39;s decision to keep the footbridge at Kensington Olympia Station open for pedestrians who, for many years, have used it as a shortcut.","Pedestrian access maintained across Kensington Olympia Station footbridge"

The boys had travelling to Cannes to take part in a youth football tournament as part of the International Town Twinning process that has been in existence since 1970 between Kensington and Chelsea and Cannes. <br /> <br />The Royal Borough has taken part in the A.S Cannes International Youth Tournament for the past twelve years. Organised by the Council, a borough representative under-11&#39;s football team from local schools has been selected. The tournament brings together boys from a wide range of backgrounds and would not have been able to continue without the sponsorship received from Cadogan Tate. <br /> <br />Cadogan Tate has been working with the Council since 2011 and is pleased to sponsor the Under-11 football team.  Paul Haynes, Director of Cadogan Tate said &#34;It is very gratifying to know that, through our sponsorship, we are able to help some of the youngsters in the borough experience international competition and to know that for many it will be their first trip abroad.&#34;  Stuart Ashe, General Manager added &#34;I was fortunate enough to attend the tournament last year and it was great to see how the squad came together.

Brain tumours are on the increase by over two per cent a year, but less than two per cent of national cancer research funds go to brain cancer research which has one of the lowest survival rates of all cancers.<br /><br />In London alone some 840 people are diagnosed with brain, central nervous system or intracranial tumours each year and at present over 2,500 people are treated in the Capital&#39;s hospitals for brain or central nervous system related tumours.<br /><br />The dog show which starts at 10.30am will be held at DoveHouse Green and features 15 classes including scruffiest in show and most like owner.  Anyone who cannot make the dog show can still enter their pooch for a virtual show at www.wayahead-btrc.org and help raise much needed funds in the process.  <br /><br />Speaking about the appeal neurosurgeon and BTRC co-founder Kevin O&#39;Neill said that the Sonowand can make surgery safer, more accurate and more complete. &#34;This results in patients living longer and has the opportunity to reap the benefits from the other research we are producing&#34;, he added. <br /><br />The Mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Cllr Christopher Buckmaster said: &#34;All too often we hear of the most dreadful illnesses which strike suddenly and can prove to be life-threatening.

And in 2011, he was chosen by other council leaders to head up the Local Government Association, the national voice for England&#39;s councils.<br /><br />He was knighted for services to local government in 2010.<br /><br />&#34;I have worked with Sir Merrick for many years and he is a true public servant and local champion,&#34; said Eric Pickles. <br /><br />&#34;Under his leadership the Council has achieved some incredible things for the residents of Kensington and Chelsea. The Tri-borough initiative he helped spearhead is a shining example of shared services savings to all in local government.&#34;<br /><br />Sir Merrick has led Kensington and Chelsea during a period in which it has been repeatedly recognised as one of Britain&#39;s best performing local authorities.  It has consistently achieved some of the highest resident approval ratings in the Capital while its residents have enjoyed one of the lowest council taxes in the country.<br /><br />As Leader he was the driving force behind the ambitious `Renewing the Legacy&#39; programme, the largest building programme in Kensington and Chelsea since the post war slum clearances.<br /><br />He personally led the long campaign for a new secondary school in Chelsea which, in 2010, delivered the Chelsea Academy.  The school won the Public Building of the Year Award in 2011 and is already rated as &#34;outstanding&#34; by Ofsted.  <br /><br />He was also closely involved in the project to rebuild Holland Park School.  Pupils took up occupation of their new school at the end of 2012.  From the outset the Council set out to build them a school to &#34;match the very best in the country.&#34;  The scheme was funded by a private land deal so profitable that it also paid for two affordable housing schemes and contributed significantly to the costs of the new academy for North Kensington currently under construction.<br /><br />Amongst a number of other public realm projects, Sir Merrick led the team responsible for the multi-award winning Exhibition Road streetscape scheme. <br /><br />An early test of his leadership was the shock discovery that the Home Office had placed Kensington and Chelsea on a list of the 20 areas most affected by crack.  Dens were springing up in the Royal Borough almost weekly and the authorities appeared impotent to deal with the crisis.  Sir Merrick was one of the principal architects of the 2002 `crack house protocol&#39;, a then unique and highly controversial commitment to close crack houses and evict the tenants within six weeks of the crack trade being confirmed as active at the premises.  He also authorised the Council&#39;s pioneering use of `S222 injunctions&#39; to ban dealers from the borough.  A series of evictions and injunctions swiftly followed and the crack den crisis eased.<br /><br />In more recent years he has helped design the Council&#39;s response to the financial crisis and the consequent dramatic falls in Government funding.  A key element of that response is the influential `Tri-Borough initiative&#39;, a radical back office and service sharing arrangement with Westminster and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham that will yield at least £10 million worth of savings to the Council by 2015.<br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s been my good fortune to work alongside an unusually talented and dedicated group of councillors and officers,&#34; said Sir Merrick.  <br /><br />&#34;Together I think we have done a good job for our residents.  Our services have been excellent, our taxes low.  And in the days when there was a lot more money around we didn&#39;t squander it, but used it wisely to build for the future. <br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s a record we can be very proud of.&#34;  <br /><br />A new leader will be elected by the Council on 22 May 2013.  <br /><br />Sir Merrick intends to remain as Chairman of the LGA for a further year and to continue to serve the people of Stanley Ward as one of their elected representatives on the Council.  In addition the Mayor of London Boris Johnson has recently appointed him to the deputy chairmanship of the London Pensions Fund Authority.  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","sir merrick cockell","Royal Borough","Leader ","Standing down ",,"Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles MP is leading the tributes to Cllr Sir Merrick Cockell who has announced today that he is to step down as Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.","Sir Merrick to step down"

In October 2011 he also took the helm at neighbouring Hammersmith &#38; Fulham following radical plans to combine a range of services, cut management costs and protect front line services.<br /><br />With Hammersmith &#38; Fulham electing a new leader last year, and Kensington and Chelsea about to choose a new leader following Sir Merrick Cockell&#39;s decision to step down after 13 years in charge, Myers has decided that now is the right time to go to allow the two council leaders to appoint a new joint Chief Executive, ready for the next round of challenges.<br /><br />The move will allow the two councils to advertise in June and enable a managed handover later in the year. <br /><br />Sir Merrick Cockell, outgoing Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;Under the guiding hand of Derek Myers Kensington and Chelsea has been one of the best performing councils in the country according to both the Audit Commission and Ofsted. Most importantly, the Council has consistently achieved the highest resident satisfaction ratings in London.<br /><br />&#34;You simply don&#39;t get our level of performance, over so many years, without a first rate chief executive.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Nicholas Botterill, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council Leader, said: &#34;By taking on the challenge of joint Chief Executive Derek led the way in reducing management costs while helping to improve council services in many areas.

Images of the installation will be projected throughout the evening. <br /><br />`Aspects of Carnival&#39; comprises thirteen panels, and will remain in situ for six months, including throughout the 2013 Notting Hill Carnival.<br /><br /> `Aspects of Carnival&#39; celebrates what is undoubtedly the area&#39;s most significant contribution to contemporary culture: the Notting Hill Carnival. Fiona Hawthorne&#39;s paintings tell the full story of Carnival - from early preparations, through to the heady excitement of the Carnival procession itself, to the big clean-up in the early hours. <br /><br />For over 15 years Fiona Hawthorne has designed and produced a large and successful Carnival arts masquerade project for young people, giving her an insight into what  takes place behind the scenes to get the show on the road. `Aspects of Carnival&#39; captures that adventure in a vibrant mix of paint and photographs, creating an extraordinary juxtaposition of colour, character and storytelling. Moreover, it expresses how Carnival fits into the  community that owns it, and captures a genuine passion for reclaiming the streets. One of the first British artists to embrace digital technology, Hawthorne here mixes contemporary painterly expression with economic lines to produce 13 works of strong integrity. <br /><br />This installation is part of `the Portobello Road North Wall Project&#39;, a public art programme from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea which enables contemporary artists to showcase their talent in one of London&#39;s most vibrant creative hubs and popular tourist destinations. <br /><br />The Portobello Road North Wall connects two of the most exciting markets in London: Portobello Road Market and Golborne Road Market. Artists creating work for the wall are invited to explore the social, historical and creative context of the area. Portobello Road is one of London&#39;s most distinctive and creative areas, particularly linked to fashion, independent music and the Notting Hill Carnival. <br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Deputy Leader of the Council  said: <br /><br />&#34;It is fitting that the new Portobello Wall installation should celebrate Carnival. For almost 50 years the streets of North Kensington have become alive with the sounds and thrilling spectacle of Carnival each August Bank Holiday weekend. However, Carnival is far more than a weekend event. It has deep and resonant roots in the local community, and animates its passion throughout the year. <br /><br />&#34;Fiona Hawthorne captures both the drama and spectacle of Notting Hill Carnival, and its central significance in the lives of the local people who create it. `Aspects of Carnival&#39; is a wonderfully fitting tribute to Carnival, and an uplifting and joyous piece of creative work which I hope everyone who visits the wall will enjoy.&#34;<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL",,,,,,"A new installation created by local artist Fiona Hawthorne is the latest to transform a 100-metre stretch along Portobello Road&#39;s North Wall.","New art installation brings &#39;Aspects of Carnival&#39; to Portobello Road"

The strong desire for residential property in the borough is reflected in values of between £750 and £2,500 per sq ft. These are increasing; there has been a 50 per cent rise in residential prices since 2009, largely as a result of inward investment from overseas. <br /><br />In contrast, typical office rental values range from £400 to £500 per sq m in the high value areas of Kensington High Street and Knightsbridge to £150 to £200 sq m in parts of north Kensington.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL",,,,,,"The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is one of just a small number of local authorities to be granted an exemption from new planning rules to be introduced by the Government that will allow offices to change into residential property without permission from local councils.","Council exempt from new planning rules"

Specialist housing construction company United House have been working on the two high-rise mansion blocks since February 2012, replacing windows, undertaking works to the roof as well as the smoke ventilation system.  <br /><br />The building&#39;s 600 replacement sash windows had to be specially made and fitted to meet planning requirements and replicate the originals.  Each new window had to be carefully carried up the stairs by three or four workers, up to six flights high.  All  brickwork was repaired and cleaned in keeping with nearby buildings, thanks to a £50,000 grant from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.<br /><br />Chris Wait, Head of Programme and Planning at Guinness South, said: &#34;The contractors were faced with many challenges on this site, one of which was that no large lorries were able to access the enclosed estate.  All the scaffolding had to be carried on to the site so it took a long time to prepare the building for the works.  Repairing the brickwork was not a simple job either; 23 different shapes and sizes of bricks were used and some had to be specially made.  Residents and shopkeepers have been very patient whilst all the work was going on.  Wind, rain and freezing conditions hindered us for a few weeks but now Holbein House almost looks like it did when it was first built in the late nineteenth century.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Timothy Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Housing, said: &#34;I am very pleased to see Holbein House looking so good after these important works and want to thank all those who have worked so hard to complete the project.

It&#39;s a record of which we are very proud.   <br /><br />&#34;Although the financial clouds are darkening, our residents continue to have the highest standards and expectations for the place they live in. They want a Council which is effective, responsive and puts their interests at the heart of all it does.  <br /><br />&#34;One of the Council&#39;s main ambitions should be to give everyone an opportunity to succeed. That requires a cross-departmental approach to regeneration, with an effective, integrated approach to housing, training, transport, employment and crime reduction. We must continue to work with our long-established voluntary sector to build a sense of belonging to the community.<br /><br />&#34;At a time of hugely demanding financial pressure on local government, we must continue to set one of the lowest council tax levels in the country. To deliver this, we need to manage our budgets prudently, to keep costs down, make the most of our joint working with Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Westminster; and generate more income from our assets.&#34;<br /><br />First elected to the Council in 1986, Councillor Paget-Brown served as Chief Whip of the Conservative Group from 2000 to 2011 and has been Deputy Leader since April 2011.<br /><br />He has also held a number of other senior positions.

He also launched the Council&#39;s first ever Arts and Culture Policy and has been responsible for the ongoing renewal of the borough&#39;s parks and gardens.  In 2007 he launched the Royal Borough Environmental Project which has `greened&#39; scores of `grot-spots&#39; in corners of the borough and supported the creation of over 300 Community Kitchen Gardens.<br /><br />Away from the Council, Nicholas Paget-Brown has a background in business and worked for a small start-up company in the City which established the UK&#39;s first online research service for financial institutions.

Brain tumours have a very low survival rate and are responsible for more deaths in children and people under the age of 40 years than any other cancer. Astonishingly less than two per cent of cancer research funding goes into brain tumours which are the Cinderella cancer. <br /><br />Cllr Buckmaster, who chose the Brain Tumour Research Campaign as his mayoral charity after a close friend was diagnosed with a brain tumour, explained: &#34;I started the campaign to increase public awareness of the desperate need for more funding and to raise funds for research at Charing Cross Hospital and specifically to help purchase a new and revolutionary surgical tool called the Sonowand. <br /><br />&#34;You know when you hear the news that someone close to you is affected you desperately want to do something to make the whole ghastly thing go away. I could not wave a magic wand to make it that happen so that is why I have raised funds to help buy a Sonowand which will improve the surgical outcome for brain tumour patients.<br /><br />&#34;People have been incredibly generous and through various events we have raised £150,000 I am now appealing to Londoners on Twitter to help me wave the wand one more time and see if we can raise some more to help the Magic Wand appeal.<br /><br />&#34;Any donation however small will go to a very good cause to improve the surgical outcome of Londoners being treated at Charing Cross Hospital.&#34;<br /><br />If you would like to make a small donation go to www.wayahead-btrc.org or email mayor@rbkc.gov.uk<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","twitter","Mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chels"," Charing Cross Hospital","Sonawand","Brain Tumour Research Campaign ","The Mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Christopher Buckmaster, who has raised over £150,000 towards the purchase of a Sonowand for use in brain surgery at Charing Cross Hospital, is turning to London Twitter users to raise a little bit more.","Twitter appeal for magic wand"

The Royal Borough&#39;s community gardeners Will and Lisa were on hand to offer gardening advice. While those residents that prefer relaxing out of doors rather than actually grafting and weeding sat back and enjoyed the Garden Cabaret.<br /><br />Other events planned later in May and early June include a plant swap stall in Earl&#39;s Court, tour of the borough&#39;s community gardens and a Green Man Tea Party at Wornington Green. For more information go to www.rbkc.gov.uk/chelseafringe or environment@rbkc.gov.uk<br /><br />The community activities are part of the Chelsea Fringe festival, which promotes a love of gardens and gardening. The Chelsea Fringe coincides and overlaps with the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Chelsea Flower Show but is completely independent of it and run mainly by volunteers.<br /><br />In 2009 the Royal Borough started developing underused plots of land as community gardens and creating `aplotments&#39; for residents to grow vegetables, fruit and herbs. There are now 40 community gardens with 700 residents working on their own plots.<br /><br />The Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for the Environment and Council leader elect, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, said: &#34;Gardening is one of the most popular pastimes and something that young and old can enjoy together.<br /><br />&#34;These events offer residents a chance to enjoy the community aspects of gardening and the arts, whether that is getting stuck in and planting flowers or sitting back and enjoying music and poetry.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Chelsea Flower Show","gardens and garden-related activities","World&#39;s End Estate, SW10 "," Chelsea Fringe ",,"The popularity of gardens and garden-related activities, evidenced by the appreciation of the Chelsea Flower Show, is spreading throughout the Royal Borough with a month-long series of garden-themed community events.","Blooming marvellous gardening events "

In addition to providing families with one-to-one support the scheme will provide parents with the opportunity to meet and share experiences with others who have also adopted older children.<br /><br />The results of the two-year programme will be scrutinised by Department of Education officials and could influence future policies relating to the care of vulnerable children.<br /><br />The three councils already work together to provide support and training for potential adopters but the new programme will mean they can increase what is currently made available to parents post-adoption for children who, though young, may have experienced trauma in their short lives.<br /><br />Welcoming the grant the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Families and Children&#39;s Service, Cllr Elizabeth Campbell, said: &#34;The AdOpt programme will allow us to provide targeted support to adoptive parents of older children who can display challenging behaviour.  It could make a real difference between a placement succeeding or failing and will provide an opportunity to help parents caring for those who are most in need.&#34;<br /><br />The grant is from the Department of Education&#39;s Intensive Interventions programme for looked after children and those on those on the edge of care.<br /><br />Hammersmith &#38; Fulham&#39;s Cabinet Member for Children&#39;s Service, Cllr Helen Binmore said: &#34;No matter how wonderful being a parent is, there are times, however, when it can be incredibly challenging. This extra funding will allow us to offer more advice, guidance and practical support to adoptive parents of some of our most vulnerable children, and help families to knit together well from the start. We always need more potential adopters to share their homes and lives, and I hope that this added support and funding will make more people come forward.&#34;<br /><br />Westminster Cabinet Member for Children and Young People Cllr Danny Chalkley added: &#34; I have pledged that adoption is a top priority in Westminster, and we are determined to build upon our strong track record so that more children who have suffered abuse and neglect can benefit from the security of a permanent loving home.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea","Tri-borough councils","Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust ","adoption, AdOpt ","Cllr Elizabeth Campbell","Three London councils, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster City Council, and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council, are set to provide a series of 16-week programmes of support and advice for adoptive parents of older children after successfully bidding for a Department of Education grant.

It is for these reasons we urge Sir Howard to publish the assessment methodology so this can be opened for public debate.<br /><br />&#34;Previous Heathrow schemes have fallen by the wayside because the promoters failed to spell out the true environmental, financial and human costs. Without this discipline there can be no confidence that the business case has been properly evaluated and the environmental impacts for local communities fully articulated.&#34;<br /><br />In 2010, Lord Justice Carnwath ruled a third runway `untenable&#39; and 2M says the airport is subject to the same constraints today:<br /><br />             The area around Heathrow currently exceeds EU pollution limits due to aviation emissions and congestion on surrounding roads<br />             The additional rail infrastructure required to support additional runway capacity has not been identified<br />             A credible, contemporary measure for the onset of community annoyance from noise has not been established.<br /><br />The councils assert that a robust assessment of Heathrow&#39;s noise, transport and air quality impacts will rule out new runways, rule out more intensive use of existing runways and highlight the need to phase out early morning flights.<br /><br />The 2M Group is an all-party alliance of local authorities concerned about the environmental impact of Heathrow operations on their communities.<br /><br />Members are not anti-Heathrow but work together to improve the environment and protect the quality of life for local people.<br /><br />The group, which took its name from the two million residents of the original 12 authorities, now represents a combined population of five million people and was successful in 2010 in overturning plans for a third runway at the airport.<br /><br />The group&#39;s priority at this stage of the review process is to make the commission fully aware of the environmental impacts that flow from any set of proposals submitted for the Heathrow site. <br /> <br />The group recently published research highlighting the new areas of London which could be affected by flight path noise if two new runways are built on the site. <br /><br />2M also warns that more runway capacity will not guarantee better connections between London and emerging markets. In practice the airlines will use extra runway slots to fly to the most profitable routes, not untested new services to cities in China. <br /> <br />For example, when BA bought up BMI&#39;s runway slots they used their increased capacity to fly more services to Alicante.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL",,,,,,"The all-party 2M Group of local authorities has warned that new proposals for extra runway capacity will fall at the first hurdle if they are not backed by scientific fact.","Davies must test airport claims"

Amongst other things, it includes plans for target times for getting to incidents and details of how savings of nearly £30m could be made.  These proposals involve the closure of 12 fire stations in London, including Knightsbridge and Westminster, and the removal of 18 fire engines across the capital, with one of Chelsea Fire Station&#39;s two engines going.  The proposals also include the reduction of 520 fire fighter posts.<br /> <br />Councillor Joanna Gardner, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Safety, said: &#34;The proposals contained in the Draft Fifth London Safety Plan would see the closure of one fire station in the borough and one in nearby Westminster as well as Chelsea Fire Station losing an engine. This is clearly of concern to the Council and to the residents and businesses, not only of Kensington and Chelsea, but also of Westminster.

The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was well represented by young people and staff involved in the `Near Peer Mentoring Project&#39;. Glen Peache, the Royal Borough&#39;s Head of Family and Care Resources, presented the opening key note speech and talked about the positive achievements of the mentoring project. <br /><br />Two young people from Kensington and Chelsea, a mentor and a mentee, talked about their experiences and achievements since joining the project. The mentor spoke about the useful work skills he has gained as well as the satisfaction of helping young people. The mentee talked about how the mentoring had helped him achieve great educational results including a B in GCSE English even though he is only 13 years old. He also spoke about becoming better able to manage his emotions and feeling more confident speaking in front of large groups of people. <br /><br />The `Near Peer Mentoring Project&#39; provides looked after children with a mentor, who is on a positive educational or employment trajectory and has also been in Council care, to support them to engage positively with education. The mentor gives practical advice and support whilst helping the looked after child to build enhanced self-belief and higher aspirations. <br /><br />Seven London boroughs: the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Bexley, Lewisham, Royal Borough of Greenwich, Islington, Hackney and Croydon took part in the project, which was also supported by the Mayor of London.  <br /><br />In Kensington and Chelsea mentoring began in October 2010 and is clearly focused on matching looked after children with care leavers to support not only their academic, but also personal and social relationships.  As well as concentrating on young people&#39;s educational attendance and performance, significant attention is given to the underlying issues behind poor attendance and performance. As well as providing bespoke educational support and tuition, the Council looks at issues such as: lack of confidence; low self-esteem; anger; conflict problems; poor behaviour; inability to make and maintain friendships, and relationships with adults and issues with authority.<br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;It has been clear for far too long that the educational prospects of children in local authority care lag behind those of other children.  I am very pleased that we have been able to take part in this mentoring project which is already showing some really positive outcomes.<br /><br />&#34;We have tried to match our looked after children with mentors who, although older, share the same background and the same experiences. This has given our looked after children the chance to talk about things such as their future careers, what university is like, how to apply and the importance of achieving good grades.&#34;<br /><br />The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: &#34;Giving young people positive role models is invaluable in helping to raise their aspirations and achieve goals. The `Near Peer Mentoring Project&#39; has proved this perfectly, with youngsters paired with mentors not only boosting their attendance at school but also improving their grades. I&#39;d like to thank everyone involved in the project and, in particular, the mentors, who have given their time so generously to help young people in care.&#34;<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","  cllr campbell ","  mentors",,,,"A project, involving the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which uses mentors to improve the overall prospects for children in the care of local authorities was celebrated at an event attended by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.","Mentors show the way to educational achievement"

Patients range in age from 16 to 62 years old.<br /> <br />The profile of users of recreational drugs contradicts the traditional stereotype of the teenage reveller. Instead, new  figures from Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea councils and the  Central North West London NHS Trust, paints a disturbing portrait of drug users who may be unaware of the risks of weekend drug taking.<br /> <br />The Club Drug Clinic, managed by Central and North West London NHS foundation Trust, has seen a steady increase in demand since opening in 2010. 60 per cent of users are older members of the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) community with the remaining 40 per cent being students and clubbers.<br /><br />The clinic now sees up to 40 people each month and the average age of users presenting for treatment is 30 to 35 with often several years of recreational use, becoming increasingly harmful. Doctors fear older party goers are coming to harm due to the effects of longer term use of drugs like ketamine, mephedrone, GBL and methamphetamine. <br /><br />Demand for treatment has been so great that the service has opened a second clinic in central London, amongst the capital&#39;s busiest clubs and bars.<br /> <br />The clinic is part-funded by the councils, Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea as part of their Public Health function, and run by Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust and based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.<br /> <br />Dr Owen Bowden-Jones, Consultant and Founder of the Clinic, said: &#34;We are seeing a change in the pattern of drug use, as more people start to use `legal highs&#39; and so-called club drugs. Many users aren&#39;t stereotypical teenage revellers, but older people with jobs and responsibilities.<br /> <br />&#34;Many people who take these drugs like GBL, Ketamine and Methamphetamine don&#39;t see themselves as `traditional&#39; drug users as they&#39;re not taking Heroin or Crack Cocaine and so don&#39;t know where to turn for help when they develop problems. Newer trends have seen a huge growth in internet purchasing of `legal highs&#39;. These drugs are often research chemicals which have been developed for their psychoactive effects but which have never been tested for safety. When we set the clinic up, we thought the primary users would be teenage clubbers, but we have seen lots of people in their 30s  and members of the LGBT community. That pattern is slowly changing, partly due to work the clinic has been doing with universities.<br /> <br />&#34;Our clinic is unique in offering help to people from all across the UK, who have come into central London, rather than just our own residents, which means that we get a national picture of drug use.&#34;<br /> <br />Cllr Rachael Robathan, Westminster Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Public Health, said: &#34;People making these so-called `legal highs&#39; are continually changing their chemical make-up, with a new product coming onto the market every week. We are told that people are increasingly buying them online, rather than in a club corridor, making the behaviour seem less of a problem and more acceptable, meaning users are often reluctant to seek help.<br /> <br />&#34;The continuing increase in use of these drugs is incredibly worrying as people could be buying anything. We want to make people aware of the problem and encourage users to seek the help available.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Mary Weale, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Public Health, said: &#34;It is important that people are aware of the risk of these &#39;legal high&#39; drugs. There is no room for complacency when drug use and addiction are such contributors to ill health. We must offer recovery-orientated treatment and make recreational drug users aware of the problems they face and the help that is available.&#34;<br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Club Drug Clinic","Central North West London NHS Trust","Westminster ","Kensington and Chelsea ","Cllr Mary Weale,","Demand for treatment for so-called `legal highs&#39; and club drugs continues to increase in London with a pioneering London clinic seeing those over 30 experiencing the greatest problems.

But the lawn is not designed to provide a replacement for grass as it cannot tolerate high footfall.  <br /><br />The new lawn requires much less maintenance than a regular grass lawn requiring only occasional mowing and very little watering.<br /><br />The Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for the Environment, Cllr Tim Ahern, said:  &#34;This floral lawn is one our most innovative measures to date to enhance the biodiversity and sustainability of our local environment.<br /><br />&#34;If successful the floral lawn will improve the diversity of Avondale Park and we will look to roll it out across the borough. We have long recognised that the Royal Borough is a very attractive place for humans to live and we want to ensure that we make it very attractive for other creatures to make their homes in it, which will undoubtedly benefit all.&#34;<br /><br />Lawn creator Lionel Smith said: &#34;It has been designed to be interactive and sensory. It is a whole mix of ornamental cultivars and of British natives as well as including some foreign things. <br /><br />&#34;By being beautiful it aids the pollinators, the bees, the butterflies, the insects, diversity is at least a third greater than a standard British lawn and the number of species is much greater usually about twenty-five per cent more as well. By being beautiful it is actually being beautiful in the greatest and widest of senses.&#34;<br /><br />Avondale Park is one of the borough&#39;s Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation, and was designated for its value to local biodiversity.  The floral lawn is just the latest addition designed to increase biodiversity and takes its place alongside loggeries, nest boxes and seeded wildflower meadows.<br /><br />The species in the lawn were grown in Holland Park nursery over the past six months by the Council&#39;s Park&#39;s Team and Quadron Services the Counci&#39;s parks maintenance contractor. <br /> <br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Avondale Park","grass-free lawn","Lionel Smith, a PhD student at the University of R"," Cabinet Member for the Environment, Cllr Tim Aher",,"The world&#39;s first grass-free lawn, made of pretty native and non-native wildflowers, colourful ornamental cultivars and some interesting non-native species, is settling in well at Avondale Park in North Kensington.

During the trial it also emerged that Mr Scott failed to notify the Council that he was working and he had inherited and significant amount of money.<br /><br />Hearing the case, the Justices concluded that Mr Scott had, throughout his evidence, failed to recall or lied.  They stated that he contradicted his interview and he repeatedly showed that he was prepared to lie.

The Council is very concerned about the effects of these changes on attendance times to emergencies in the borough and will be responding that if the Fire Service is to press ahead with the closure of Knightsbridge Fire Station the Council will be seeking to keep the second engine at Chelsea Fire Station to ensure there is sufficient capacity.<br /><br />Councillor Joanna Gardner, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Safety, said: &#34;Clearly local people feel very strongly about these proposals and have real concerns.

Allowing for delays in spending and other matters, this represents five per cent of the Council&#39;s annual, recurrent budget.<br /><br />It has not been achieved through reducing the quality of the Council&#39;s services but by Bi- and Tri-borough working, cost control and preparing for reductions in the Council&#39;s grant from central Government for several years to come.<br /><br />The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has also maintained a healthy credit rating according to its most recent assessment by the ratings agency Standard &#38; Poor&#39;s which awarded the borough a AAA/negative rating.<br /><br />This latest rating reflects the borough&#39;s economic strength, substantial reserves and moderate debt levels and its intention to implement further cuts to its operating expenditure to match lower revenues from the Government.<br /><br />Standard &#38; Poor&#39;s report that the borough&#39;s budgetary performance has been good with strong control over budgeted costs.  It also points out that the Council&#39;s ongoing cautious fiscal stance has allowed it to build up substantial reserves which provide a cushion to accommodate current and future reductions in revenue arising from  reductions in Government grants.<br /><br />Despite continuous cuts in its main sources of revenue over the past few years the Council has been able to avoid running a deficit owing to major efforts in reining in operating costs.  The borough will continue to benefit from the Tri-borough initiative, through which it shares services with Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Westminster and thus saving on overheads and achieving lower procurement costs.<br /><br />The Council&#39;s financial management is singled out as having a positive impact on the rating it received.  This demonstrates a high degree of expertise and commitment to transparency as well as continuity, fiscal discipline and well defined financial policies.<br /><br />The capital programme foresees investment of £170 million from 2013-2014 onward.  This programme will require £124 million of Council funding which will come mainly from the borough&#39;s own reserves and capital receipts.  The programme is spread across a large number of diverse projects and includes the building of the Kensington Aldridge Academy and the Kensington Leisure Centre.<br /><br />Cllr Warwick Lightfoot, Cabinet Member for Finance and Strategy, said: &#34;This year&#39;s accounts show that once again the Council has managed to use your money wisely.  Front line services have been preserved, if not enhanced, and savings have been found to match the reduction in Government grant.<br /><br /> &#34;I am very pleased that having run the rule over the Council&#39;s finances and financial management Standard &#38; Poor&#39;s has given us such a healthy rating.  Clearly the decisions we have taken to share services with our neighbours and our careful stewardship of our reserves over many years has gone some way to protect vital front line services while still allowing us to make a substantial capital investment in new schools.&#34;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cllr lightfoot","Standard &#38; poor&#39;s",,,,"A draft set of the Council&#39;s accounts for 2012-13 was presented to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet on Thursday 13 June.

However, this consent was heavily conditioned to ensure the retention of historic features throughout the building.  <br /><br />Both defendants pleaded guilty to executing the unauthorised works and architect Mr Joshua Whitfield Berry was fined £3,000, plus £5,000 costs and Elston Developments Limited was fined £2,000, plus £5,000 costs.<br /><br />The court heard how the works carried out in February and March 2012 were significantly over and above what had been approved and how they caused irreversible damage seriously affecting the building&#39;s architectural and historic interest.<br /><br />These works effectively gutted the interior of the property and included the removal of the majority of the plasterwork from ceilings and walls; the removal of floorboards, skirting boards, dado rails and other timber features and the removal of most of the historic cornicing and some fireplaces.  The end result was the complete exposure of the skeletal timber framing of the building and its internal bare brick walls on every floor level.  In addition, the rear garden&#39;s balustrade wall and staircase were removed. <br /><br />Councillor Tim Coleridge, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Planning, said:<br /><br />&#34;We are fortunate to be home to a vast number of historic and architecturally significant buildings and it is our duty to protect and preserve them so they can be enjoyed by future generations.<br /><br />&#34;Our enforcement team closely monitor building works and this case sends a strong message to architects and building contractors that planning conditions must be observed and, if breached, we will ensure that they are made to account for their actions.&#34;<br /><br />In January 2013, a further Listed Building Consent was approved to carry out some structural works to be the property and to ensure, where possible, the reinstatement of historically correct features to the building.

The borough had to settle for bronze last year, after winning gold in 2011, but they were back to winning ways at the London Regatta Centre.<br /><br />Brothers Alexander,15, and Oliver Khlaf ,13, took senior male and junior male gold respectively. Sister Sophie, 16, was fourth in the senior female class, the quarter was completed by Lilla Shehata, 11, who was a solid seventh in the junior female class.<br /><br />Each competitor had two runs over the course with the best three of the four in the team to count. Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s quickest were the three Khlafs and they just edged out Bexley into silver by two seconds. Last year&#39;s winner Tower Hamlets had to settle for bronze.<br /><br />In the kayak sprint competition, there was more success for the borough as they shared overall team bronze with Ealing, Barking &#38; Dagenham took silver with Richmond winning the overall title. There was also individual gold in the rocket class through Alexander and Oliver Khlaf, Lilla Shehata and 12-year-old Madeleine Sigey.<br /><br />There were further medals for Alexander Khlaf who won silver in the male junior cirrus class, Lilla Shehetta who took bronze in the cirrus junior female finals and Sophie Klaf who won bronze in the senior female cirrus class. <br /><br />Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Team Coach Martyn Steele was pleased with the team&#39;s performance. He said: &#34;We&#39;re all very proud because they all worked so hard throughout the year. They come training even when there&#39;s ice on the canal and they all love to paddle. So for them to actually get a reward today is great and reflects the hard work they put in all year.<br /><br />&#34;Some of the boys train up to five times a week, and put in a lot of work - they deserve everything they get for the training they do.<br /><br />&#34;Every year the standard at the London Youth Games gets better and better. It&#39;s good to see so many people getting involved because it&#39;s still a minority sport. The more people we can get involved - especially within London because of the diversity of the population - the better. To see so many people here from all backgrounds - it&#39;s amazing.&#34;<br /><br />Oliver Khlaf was also delighted, he said: &#34;I feel very happy and I feel like I deserved it because I tried really hard. I`ve been training all year for this event - it&#39;s one of the most important events of the year so I tried really hard.&#34; <br /><br />He also revealed that he has big ambitions for the future, saying he hopes to follow London 2012 kayak slalom silver medallist Richard Hounslow from the London Youth Games all the way to the Olympics. <br /><br />He said: &#34;It shows that people started in London Youth Games and can then go on to achieve Olympic medals, so it&#39;s really inspiring. I definitely hope to go to bigger events and hopefully achieve an Olympic medal one day.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said: &#34;Congratulations to all our kayakers for their fantastic efforts at the London Youth Games.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for taking this leap forward to improve people&#39;s lives. Plans, which are set to save around £38 million net per year, will integrate health and social care support to enable more people to stay independent in their own home.&#34;<br /><br />Westminster Council, along with the NHS and neighbouring Hammersmith &#38; Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea Councils, which have led the way in local government by combining services, are one of just four areas in the country to be given special `Community Budget pilot&#39; status by the Government to develop radical plans for public service redesign. <br /><br />The integrated care model will provide targeted support to the 20 per cent of people who are currently responsible for 77 per cent of health and social care cost. They will be given help and support to be cared for in their own homes, reducing demand for more expensive institutionalised care either in a hospital setting or residential home. <br /><br />Cllr Marcus Ginn, Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Care, said: &#34;These innovative plans are about providing much more joined-up care so that people receive the best possible standard of services in their own home with care packages designed around their needs.<br /><br />&#34;In future we won&#39;t be asking vulnerable people to navigate their own way around the NHS which can be daunting at the best of times; they will have their own nominated person to do that for them, regardless of whether they need social care, occupational therapy or mental health care.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Mary Weale, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care and Public Health, said: &#34;By focusing on an integrated approach we will make effective early intervention to provide the support that will enable people to stay in their own home which for most people is a more attractive option than moving into residential care which is also costly for the taxpayer.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Rachael Robathan, Westminster City Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Adults and Public Health, said: &#34;Our pilot has shown the potential of what can be achieved when local knowledge is put at the heart of Whitehall decision making.  <br />&#34;We are committed to delivering our ambitious plans but we will only be successful with the continued backing of Ministers and their officials, so we are delighted to welcome ministers to view our services and discuss our plans today.<br /><br />&#34;This is about changing the way primary health and social care services are delivered, with acute or residential care becoming the last resort not the first destination.&#34;<br /><br />This year, the three councils will start to implement plans that will see them work in new ways with local partners to release £38 million per year of net savings after reinvestment costs at a local level and deliver better outcomes for local people, keeping more people out of hospital for longer. This is particularly important for the 100,000 who are elderly or have complex needs and are most at risk of being admitted to hospital or a care home. <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Community Budget pilot&#39; ","integrated care model ","Cllr Mary Weale","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea ",,"Minister of State for Health, Norman Lamb MP and Minister for Local Government, Brandon Lewis MP (Tuesday 18 June)  praised the efforts of three London councils to provide better care for the elderly through an innovative integrated care pilot.

This is particularly important for bees and butterflies which are in significant decline and under increasing threat through loss of habitat, sources of food and pollen, and the use of pesticides. <br /><br />The project is the result of collaboration between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council and Lionel Smith, a PhD student at the University of Reading who came up with the idea for the lawn.  <br /><br />Welcoming the development, Cllr Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environment at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;I am delighted we are at the forefront of such an exciting and innovative way of bringing biodiversity to the borough.<br /><br />&#34;I would like to congratulate Lionel Smith for his ideas in creating this lawn and also the borough&#39;s parks team for growing the species that are now doing so well in Avondale Park.<br /><br />&#34;I look forward to seeing the lawn in other parks in the borough and hopefully in other parts of the country.&#34;<br /><br />Lionel Smith added: &#34;I&#39;ve been delighted by how the grass-free lawn concept has been so very well received by all the park users I have spoken to. It has been very rewarding to take cutting-edge research out of the experimental grounds and directly apply it in Avondale Park. I look forward to seeing how the lawn evolves. It certainly seems to have set many people thinking.&#34;<br /><br />By completely replacing grass with a wide variety of carefully selected wildflowers of both native and non-native plant species it is possible to create a richly structured and highly biodiverse sward that is both visually and structurally attractive to people, pollinators and other invertebrates. <br /><br />Once the lawn has settled, it will be able to take occasional light footfall; and young park users will be able to step on the lawn and get up close to the variety of flowers and plants used. This will provide an innovative approach to biodiversity enhancements in an urban park.  However the floral lawn is not designed to provide a replacement for hardwearing turf.  It provides an engaging way to bring nature to our residents&#39; doorstep increasing their contact with nature, and is already receiving positive feedback.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Floral lawn","lawn","Avondale ","park",,"The world&#39;s first grass-free lawn in a public space, made entirely of flowers, was laid last month at Avondale Park, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

These buyers are able to invest huge sums of money in very large residential units.  The Council proposes to restrict very large units in a scheme to 25 per cent of the overall floor space.  <br /><br />The Royal Borough has also seen a trend for the creation of larger properties through the amalgamation of smaller ones and estimates that this has resulted in the loss of an average of over 50 dwellings a year since 2009.  These new guidelines propose to restrict this practice, except where the amalgamation is within a house, which had been previously split into flats.  <br /> <br />Subterranean development has increased dramatically in recent years and has been the subject of concerns from residents.  This has been heightened by the growth in the number of planning applications for basements from 13 planning applications in 2001, to 182 in 2010 and 307 in 2012.  Basement development has given rise to issues about noise and disturbance during construction and concerns about the structural stability of nearby buildings.  <br /> <br />Designed to introduce a sense of proportionality to basement development, highlights of these new policies include a reduction in the extent to which basements can extend into the garden, a restriction to a single storey and severe restrictions on basement developments under, or in the gardens, of listed buildings, or where a basement already exists.<br /> <br />At the same time the Council wants to encourage an increase in the number of affordable homes being built. It is proposing to raise the threshold where affordable housing should be built on site to 2,400 sq m.  Below this threshold, developers will be required to make a financial contribution towards affordable housing. The Council believes that this is a realistic approach to encourage developers to build affordable homes as part of new developments.  <br /><br />Councillor Tim Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said:<br /> <br />&#34;Over the past decade we&#39;ve noticed a dramatic increase in the number of basement applications and at the same time a distinct pattern has also emerged of foreign investors investing huge sums of money in very large residential units.<br /> <br />&#34;With some of the most expensive land values in the country it is a constant challenge for us to build affordable homes.<br /> <br />&#34;Through these policies we are trying to get the right balance between residents, investors and a meaningful increase in the number of affordable homes we deliver.&#34;<br /> <br />These proposals will be presented to the Government&#39;s Planning Inspector in the autumn who will decide whether they are sound.  If given the go-ahead, the Council hopes to introduce the new policies early next year.<br /> <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","planning guidelines  ","affordable homes ","basements","cllr coleridge","Royal Borough of Kensington and CHelsea ","Planning guidelines to help control developments above and below ground and to increase the number of affordable homes were last night (Wednesday 26 June) approved by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.","Guidelines approved to control basement development and increase the number of affordable homes"

An agreement with TfL means that the community has been able to transform what had previously been a neglected and drab space by a very busy road.<br /><br />The first stage of brightening up the planters began in March when they were cleared and planted. Since then the community has agreed a planting plan with TfL and secured a grant from Norland City Living Local Life to buy the plants.  <br /><br />A big community planting day took place on Sunday 7 July when 15 local residents, with the support of the Council, transformed two large planters with a fantastic selection of new plants. The community planting day was a great way for residents to get to know each other and help improve their local environment. The residents braved the hot weather and planted well over 100 different shrubs and flowers. The hard work was appreciated by passers-by on the day who commented on a great job the local community was doing and how good the planters looked.<br /><br />Norland ward Councillor, Julie Mills, said: &#34;It is a real joy to be able to use City Living Local Life community funds to beautify this neglected area. This is the gateway to the borough. It was great fun to get stuck in with the weeding planting and watering team and in the glorious sunshine. We are all grateful to officers and residents for bringing this project to fruition. <br /> <br />Councillor Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environment, said: &#34;Thanks to the determination of local people and the cooperation of TfL these rather unloved planters are getting a new lease of life which will certainly brighten up the local area.&#34;<br /><br />The planters will now be maintained by the local community.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Cllr Mills","cllr ahern",,,,"Two large unsightly planters by the busy Holland Park Avenue roundabout have been given a horticultural makeover driven by the local community.

Borough residents seeking treatment can access services via either hub.  <br /> <br />Welcoming the integrated approach the Royal Borough&#39;s Mayor, Cllr Williams, said: &#34;For every £1 spend on drug treatment £2.50 is saved in the costs to the community. Successful drug treatment promotes and improves well-being, reduces emergency hospital admissions, cuts crime and reduces re-offending and prevents drug-related deaths and illnesses.<br /><br />&#34;Providing access to all available treatment at either hub is already proving successful.

However, an investigation by council and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) investigators discovered she had been receiving interest on capital in accounts that had not been declared for benefit purposes. Bank statements obtained for the undeclared accounts showed that her capital exceeded £44,000 between October 2009 and March 2012. Normally savings in excess of £16,000 entail a reduction in benefits payable.<br /> <br />A guilty plea was registered by Kate Horgan at Hammersmith Magistrates&#39; Court on 14 May.  Due to the amount of the overpayment the case was then referred to Isleworth Crown Court for sentencing on 8 July. However, at the sentencing hearing Miss Horgan confirmed she had no intention of repaying the debt and would rather go to prison.  Therefore, the matter was adjourned whilst a financial investigator from the London Borough of Hammersmith &#38; Fulham worked to successfully freeze her bank accounts under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. <br /> <br />The matter was heard again at Isleworth Crown Court on 18 July.  The Judge ordered Miss Horgan to repay the full amount of the overpayments from the frozen bank accounts or face 11 months&#39; imprisonment. She was further ordered to pay a fine of £7,500 or face six months&#39; imprisonment. She was also ordered to pay the full costs of the lengthy legal proceedings taken by Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea which amounted to £3,753.50.<br /> <br />During the period 12 October 2009 to 29 April 2012, Miss Horgan was overpaid Housing Benefit amounting to £12,033.82 and Job Seeker&#39;s Allowance amounting to £5,325.93.<br /> <br />Councillor Warwick Lightfoot, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Finance and Strategy, said: &#34;This woman chose deliberately to conceal the amount of money she had saved in order to claim benefits.

Each year it provides assistance to over 2,000 people, 340 of whom are Royal Borough residents and of these 240 are cared for in their own homes.<br /><br />Last year Trinity staff made over 1,100 individual visits to patients in Kensington and Chelsea, this included 975 nurse visits, as well as visits from the Patient and Family Support team, doctors, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. <br /><br />As well as providing nursing and medical care Trinity Hospice offers practical and emotional support for patients and their families. The hospice also shares its skills with other care providers including care homes, hospitals, GPs and district nurses.<br /><br />All the care is given entirely free of charge and the charity relies on support from the local community to generate the majority of its funding. In the Royal Borough, the hospice has five shops to supplement donations (one in King&#39;s Road, two in Kensington Church Street, one in Bute Street and one in Notting Hill Gate).  <br /><br />Cllr Williams said: &#34;Trinity Hospice has been caring for the people of Kensington and Chelsea and Central and south-west London for over 120 years. At a very emotional and critical time in a person&#39;s life Trinity Hospice is there to provide care, support and friendship, either at the hospice in Clapham or in their own home.<br /> <br />&#34;Trinity shops are a vital source of income for the charity and I want to encourage people to support them either by shopping in them or becoming a volunteer. All profits raised in the shops go directly to the charity which costs nearly £10 million a year to run. The Government can only provide 30 per cent of the funding so the remaining £7 million must be raised from the public by donations or their support of the shops.&#34;<br /><br />Sally Bateson, Trinity Hospice&#39;s Director of Fundraising and Communications, said: &#34;We are delighted to have the support of the Mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea this year. We are very much looking forward to working with him and his team to raise both funds and awareness in the Royal Borough over the coming months.

The café had been warned as early as May 2012 that its shelter for smoking did not comply with legislation*. The first offence involved five people smoking inside the café. The second offence followed a complaint from a member of the public when about 20 people were smoking shisha pipes inside the illegal shelter and the main building. On the third occasion 20 or 30 people were witnessed doing the same.<br /><br />The main manager of the café, Mr Farid Ejlali, had previously been fined £600 for two of the same breaches at Hammersmith Magistrates&#39; court on 13 August 2013 after pleading guilty by post.

SNOW'S LEGACY","Join six of the leading luminaries from the worlds of science and the arts for a half day conference debating the Two Cultures and the legacy of English chemist, C.P. Snow at Kensington Town Hall.<br /><br />In 1959 Snow delivered an influential Rede Lecture called The Two Cultures which provoked widespread and heated debate at the time. Subsequently published as The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution, the lecture argued that the breakdown of communication between the &#34;two cultures&#34; of modern society - the sciences and the humanities - was a major hindrance to solving the world&#39;s problems. In particular, Snow argued that the quality of education in the world is on the decline. <br /><br />Snow&#39;s Rede Lectures specifically condemned the British educational system, as having since the Victorian period over-rewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek) at the expense of scientific education. He believed that in practice this deprived British elites (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation for managing the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled those countries&#39; rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. <br /><br />The Two Cultures will be revisited and Snow&#39;s legacy debated by Lord May FRS, Professor George Steiner, Professor Frank James, Baroness Warnock, Professor Martin Roth, Director V&#38;A and Paul Thompson, Rector RCA.<br /><br />The conference, which is free to attend, takes place in Committee Room 1 of Kensington Town Hall, Hornton Street, W8 7NX, between 3pm and 7pm, on Wednesday 25 September and is part of a Celebration of Science, a week of thought provoking, inspiring and entertaining talks on the world of science organised by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the Natural History Museum, Imperial College, the Royal College of Art and other major institutions.<br /><br />For more information on Celebration of Science visit www.rbkc.gov.uk/celebrationofscience<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","   celebration of science",,,,,"Join six of the leading luminaries from the worlds of science and the arts for a half day conference debating the Two Cultures and the legacy of English chemist, C.P.

An unused office space at Greaves Tower, World&#39;s End Estate, is the first in the programme to be completed, having been turned into three separate two-bedroom units. <br /><br />A small group, including Councillor Feilding-Mellen, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Housing, Property and Regeneration, RBKC Director of Housing Laura Johnson, Chair of the TMO Board, Fay Edwards and Residents&#39; Association Chair, John Rendall, joined TMO Chief Executive Robert Black for a tour of the new homes on Friday morning (13 September 2013).<br /><br />Mr Black said: &#34;A key consideration for the programme is adding to our stock of accessible housing for people with mobility problems. All the new homes are built to `Lifetime Homes&#39; specifications and we are really proud that they have been delivered to a very high standard.&#34;<br /><br />The Royal Borough&#39;s Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Housing, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellensaid: &#34;I am really pleased to see this old office space brought back into use as housing for local people. We have great need for more affordable homes for people who live and work in the borough, and so this and other developments we have coming up over the next few months will help to deliver the Council&#39;s aspiration of providing lower cost homes for those in housing need.&#34;<br /><br />The three homes have applicants ready to move in as soon the keys are made available. Two applicants are from the Homeless Persons Register and one is a TMO tenant who is transferring on medical grounds.<br /><br />Transferring TMO tenant Mercedes Morris, who has mobility difficulties and uses a walking aid, says she is thrilled with her more accessible new home. <br /><br />&#34;I&#39;m currently on the fourth floor and I rely on family to do a lot of my shopping and errands.

I would like to thank residents and Council officers for their hard work and the pride they show in how the borough looks, this is a great result for all of them.<br /><br />&#34;We thought that last year was a great year for the borough, but we have managed to better it this year. <br /><br />&#34;Since last year we have continued to build on our commitment to parks and the open spaces in the borough, indeed Avondale Park has the first grass free lawn in a public space in Europe and we hope will prove a template for others.

Those Councillors would represent 14 three-member wards and four two-member wards in the borough. <br /><br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &#34;I thank the Boundary Commission for its recommendations and for listening so carefully to local representations from both the Council and residents.&#34;<br /><br />Max Caller, Chair of the Commission, said, &#34;We are extremely grateful to the people of Kensington and Chelsea who took the time and effort to send us their views. The Commission considered every piece of evidence it received before finalising these recommendations.<br /><br />&#34;Across the borough we have sought to balance the views expressed to us by local people with the criteria we must apply when we are deciding on new electoral arrangements. As such, we believe these recommendations deliver electoral equality for voters as well as reflecting the identities of communities across Kensington and Chelsea.&#34; <br /><br />In response to the views submitted during the consultation, the Commission proposes some changes to the draft recommendations it put forward in March.  <br /><br />The proposals are that the museums and streets to the north of Cromwell Road should be part of the Hans Town ward rather than Queen&#39;s Gate as originally suggested in the draft plans. In addition, the whole of Onslow Square will be included within Courtfield ward instead of being divided between wards. Finally, and in response to submissions made to it, the Commission proposes that part of St Charles ward should be called St Helen&#39;s and that Hans Town ward should be called Brompton and Hans Town in recognition of the strong evidence of community identity for the Brompton area. <br /><br />The new arrangements must now be implemented by Parliament. A draft order - the legal document which brings into force the recommendations - will be laid before Parliament in the next few months. The draft order provides for the new electoral arrangements to come into force at the council elections in 2014.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL"," Cllr paget-brown ","boundary commission ",,,,"Final recommendations for new electoral arrangements for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea have been published by the independent Local Government Boundary Commission for England.","Boundary Commission publishes proposals for Royal Borough"

This figure exceeds the original estimate of £40 million.<br /><br />The three councils are sharing £300 million of services, cutting management costs in these areas by half.<br /><br />Savings made from the ground-breaking alliance have helped the three local authorities to keep their council tax amongst the lowest in the country. WCC has the second lowest average council tax in Britain, H&#38;F is third and the Royal Borough is fourth.<br /><br />Leader of the Royal Borough, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown said: &#34;Tri-borough working is helping protect front line services by reducing spending. But we must continue to look at ways to bring costs down and ensure we get value for money. We will do this by looking at opportunities to procure services jointly and by benchmarking the services we provide against other providers to ensure there is no wastage or spending incurred that we are not aware of.&#34;<br /><br />Hammersmith &#38; Fulham Council Leader, Cllr Nicholas Botterill said: &#34;We always knew that combining services was a common-sense move as we looked to safeguard vital services. These latest saving figures show, without shadow of a doubt, that our bold decision to work together back in 2011 has been fully vindicated.<br /><br />&#34;Inevitably, the journey has been complicated at times but we are on track to save taxpayers more money than we ever imagined while protecting and even improving front line services. This is not the end of the story and we are exploring all areas of the council to look at future opportunities.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Philippa Roe, leader of Westminster City Council, said: &#34;Our Tri-borough collaboration has proven itself a highly effective way of delivering excellent services while keeping costs down, and stripping out unnecessary duplication. This approach is further underlined by the fact we are saving £3 million more than originally envisaged. <br /> <br />&#34;We will continue to look for further savings and areas to cooperate on to ensure that taxpayers&#39; money works as hard as possible, and that we keep providing those front line services we know people really value.&#34;<br /><br />The three councils have achieved the savings by sharing children&#39;s services (saving £2.68 million a year by 2015/16), adult social care (saving £3.2 million) and library services (saving £146,000) across the three boroughs significantly reducing senior and middle management overheads.<br /><br />Environment, leisure and residents services, together with transport and technical services are combined on a bi-borough basis between Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith &#38; Fulham. This is on course to save £4.2million by 2015/16. The two authorities already share a chief executive, a single legal department and a single human resources team.<br /><br />The additional £3 million is as a result of greater than expected savings that have been found predominantly as a result of sharing more staff than first envisaged, sharing back office functions, procurement and aligning major contracts where possible.<br /><br /><br />With many councils across the country cutting front line services as a result of the national debt crisis, residents in Hammersmith &#38; Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster are noticing improved services as a result of this new way of working. Improvements include:<br /><br /> The one library card policy, giving residents, workers and students unprecedented access to more than one million library books and a range of specialist collections.<br /><br /> Shared foster placements across the three boroughs, helping to find looked after children a loving home faster.<br /><br /> The length of care proceedings has been halved from 52 to 26 weeks and reduced legal costs significantly.<br /><br />The three councils have also shown, through their `whole-place&#39; Community Budget pilot, that within five years they could, with the co-operation of central government departments, create annual savings of about £80 million across local public services in the area. If fully implemented, the plans developed through the recent pilot would help drive growth, reduce dependency, build homes, create jobs, lengthen lives and rehabilitate criminals, according to the councils.<br /><br />In February 2013, the councils signed up to a contract with BT that will save local taxpayers more than £6 million over the next eight years. The managed service contract will enable the councils and BT to radically redesign the councils&#39; human resources and finance services.<br /><br />A Tri-borough approach has also now been adopted for the three councils&#39; new public health function. A shared public health function, led by a single director of public health is now looking to push innovation in the design of health and prevention services across the three boroughs.<br /><br />In October, a Tri-borough facilities management contract will be implemented with Amey.  The contract will run for ten years and is expected to save each of the three councils over £2 million a year (equivalent to more than a 34 per cent saving over current costs) through operational efficiency.<br /><br />A sovereignty guarantee signed by the three councils ensures local accountability and decision making, with each of the three councils remaining responsible for their own budgets, policies and service specification.<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","savings","Tri-Borough","Leader of the Royal Borough, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown",,,"Combining management costs and services at three flagship councils is saving more money than ever envisaged.","Combining services saving more money than ever envisaged"

This time a bare patch of ground to the side of the flats was turned into a garden with 21 plots with the gardeners comprising a mixture of private homeowners and tenants from the flats.<br /> <br />Each year the Council adds between five and ten new gardens to the borough&#39;s crop of community gardens, currently numbering 42.

The work, which will take up to 18 months, will be undertaken by Costain. <br /><br />It is the second and final phase of strengthening of the flyover following the first phase which was completed last year. The flyover will not be closed during peak times. <br /> <br />In December 2011 TfL found that steel cables on a number of the flyover&#39;s 16 spans had deteriorated significantly, due to corrosion caused by water seeping into the structure. This led to its temporary closure just before Christmas and subsequent urgent strengthening work on the worst affected spans allowing the flyover to fully reopen to traffic in May 2012.<br /> <br />Work is now required to complete the strengthening of the remaining spans and undertake essential planned maintenance to ensure that the structure remains safe and usable for years to come. <br /> <br />The work will involve the installation of additional structural cables to strengthen the spans, replacing the bridge bearings and the drainage system, waterproofing and resurfacing the deck to stop future internal corrosion and strengthening the walls at either end of the flyover. <br />Works will begin with the installation of scaffolding and hoarding around the structure to allow work inside and below the flyover. No traffic restrictions will be in place on the flyover during this time, but overnight closures on the roads below will be required to facilitate the works. <br /> <br />All night-time closures will be between 10.30pm and 5am. <br /> <br />From January to June 2014 the central reservation and drainage will be upgraded, which will require the temporary reduction of the width of all lanes on the flyover. Larger vehicles will be required to use specific lanes. During this period it will be necessary to close the flyover in one direction every few nights to allow materials to be safely delivered and collected from the flyover deck. <br /><br />It will be necessary to carry out a limited number of weekend closures in one direction between June and September 2014 and TfL plans to do the majority of these during the summer school holiday to minimise disruption. <br /><br />The weekend closures (Friday evening to Monday morning in one direction only) will be required to carry out concrete repairs, replace the waterproofing and resurface the flyover deck. TfL will ensure that the date and time of these closures and diversion routes are widely advertised ahead of the works. Night time closures will then again be required between September and December 2014 to carry out strengthening of the walls at either end of the flyover and replacement of the expansion joints on the top of the flyover. <br /> <br />TfL is running an Information Centre showing details of the Hammersmith Flyover&#39;s construction, its history and the planned strengthening and refurbishment works. This will take place on <br /> Friday 4 October ¬- 10am until 8pm <br /> Saturday 5 October - 10am until 4pm <br /><br />at St Paul&#39;s Church, Queen Caroline Street, London W6 9PJ.<br /> <br />TfL, Costain and its designers, Ramboll-Parsons Brinckerhoffs, will be available to listen to your comments and answer any questions about the works that you may have. <br /> <br />Councillor Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Transportation, said: &#34;Clearly any major work on the Hammersmith Flyover will have a major impact on local traffic.

Scientists of the future also played their part with several talented young scientists from Imperial College lending their knowledge and expertise.<br /><br />A series of distinguished speakers included Lord May FRS (Oxford University and a former President of the Royal Society), Professor George Steiner FBA, Sir Roy Anderson FRS (Imperial College), Professor Frank James (of the Royal Institution), Professor Terence Kealey (Vice-Chancellor of Buckingham University), Lord Taverne (former Chairman of Sense about Science) and Professor Chris Stringer FRS (Natural History Museum).<br /><br />The week confirmed a wide and healthy interest in scientific matters and all the events attracted enthusiastic audiences of all ages. Events during the week linked into TEDxAlbertopolis at the Royal Albert Hall and to the Science Uncovered evening at the Natural History Museum.  A specially commissioned day at the Natural History Museum attracted 450 Year 6 children from local schools, where the matters covered linked directly to their current school work.  <br /><br />The Celebration of Science examined some of the serious and interesting contemporary scientific issues. These included a presentation by Mike Tildesley, a mathematician who models the spread of diseases such as avian flu and foot and mouth Disease, exploring probability and the range of uncertainty involved in assessing the course of an epidemic. Dr David Ogbolu, the Royal Society Newton International Research Fellow, a microbiologist, explored the science of diseases that are resistant to antibiotics. This complemented the speech made by the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies at the TEDxAlbertopolis event where she expressed her serious concern about this development.<br /><br />Councillor Warwick Lightfoot, Cabinet Member for Finance and Strategy, who had responsibility for organising Celebration of Science, said: &#34;I am delighted that so many people were able to come along and enjoy, learn and be stimulated by the fascinating range of science events that we put on. There was something for everyone. An exploration of the life of Sir Hans Sloane, the continuing debate about the two cultures, modern British science policy and the scope and efficiency of British science, as well as a rigorous examination of a wide range of science from mathematical biology to the astrophysics of the origins the Earth and how life will evolve over the next billion years. Clearly, there is a very rich scientific heritage here in Kensington and Chelsea and, judging from the reaction of some of the younger people who attended, we are well placed to build on this.<br /><br />&#34;I&#39;d particularly like to thank all our speakers for their quality contributions and making complex things so understandable and interesting and to thank all the great institutions that helped to make this event possible.&#34;<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cllr lightfoot","Celebration of Science ",,,,"A week-long Celebration of Science, which drew on the strong local science base and the rich legacy of scientific research and scholarship in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, has been an outstanding success.","A look back at Celebration of Science week"

Both Baroness Hanham and Sir Michael Craig-Cooper are Freemen of the Royal Borough and have had meeting rooms named after them as had the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who was made a Freeman in 1979.    <br /><br />Since 2010 the 33-year-old building has been undergoing a substantial refurbishment programme, to allow the replacement of heating and electrical systems which had reached the end of their economical life, and to increase the office capacity of the building so it can accommodate more staff in order to free outlying office buildings some of which can now be let commercially. <br /><br />The work will allow the Council to lower its property costs, overheads, carbon foot print and deliver ongoing savings of over £2.56 million per year.<br /><br />The refurbished basement has 10 meeting rooms which are equipped with the latest IT facilities and are capable of accommodating between them 10 and 44 people. In addition to meeting rooms it features a reception and waiting area, café with extensive seating, staff showers, toilets, quiet room, print and post room, and first aid room. <br /><br />The Freeman Suite name is in recognition of the significant contribution Nicholas Freeman made to life in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea during his service as Leader of the Council from 1977 to 1989. On standing down in May of 1989 he was promptly elected as Mayor, a capacity in which he served until his death in November of that year.<br /><br />The Freedom of the Borough is the highest honour which the Council can bestow.

During this time 231 high performance cars were counted in the area with 30 visiting each night.  <br /><br />In the first instance 45 letters urging drivers to have consideration for local residents were handed to those witnessed leaving their engines idling.  Verbal warnings were given to 13 drivers, all of which immediately complied with a request to switch off their engines.<br /><br />Six cars were found without insurance and were towed away. Some were also towed as the tinted glass was too dark and therefore illegal to drive.<br /><br />It is not only powerful supercars that are causing problems in the area. At the other end of the horsepower spectrum action was taken against the operators of pedicabs, a rickshaw-like bike, providing a taxi service. In the two-week operation 173 pedicabs were counted in the area and 30 were spotted each night.  The bikes often blast out loud music from stereos controlled by passengers&#39; smart phones and also cause an obstruction by mounting pavements, particularly on Beauchamp Place.<br /><br />Councillor Joanna Gardner, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Safety, IT and Corporate Services, said: &#34;We are going to keep a close eye on the behaviour of drivers of these powerful cars and the operators of pedicabs.

Launched in February by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, ECAT is a two-year European Commission funded programme to identify and support victims of trafficking in this borough and Westminster.<br /> <br />The Royal Borough is the lead organisation for the initiative and is working with the Metropolitan Police&#39;s specialist anti-trafficking unit and partner agencies Rahab UK, STOP THE TRAFFIK UK, Borgorete in Italy and Caritas in Lithuania.  These specialists are raising awareness in communities and amongst professionals and equipping vulnerable groups with skills for resisting traffickers. They also providing victim support services to increase safety and prevent re-trafficking of victims.<br /><br />In the past six months, almost 100 vulnerable people in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the City of Westminster have been identified and approximately ten victims of trafficking have been helped to escape as a result of the ECAT project. Additionally, ten traffickers have been arrested and over £100,000 of assets have been seized by the police. <br /> <br />Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Leader of the Royal Borough, said:<br /> <br />&#34;Too often this heinous crime goes undetected in large cities and this event is designed to help raise awareness of the issue amongst ordinary people.<br /> <br />&#34;Human trafficking is a complex issue and resources need to be given to those organisations both at home and abroad that have a successful track record in helping to stamp out this terrible practice.&#34;<br /> <br />For more information on the project visit www.rbkc.gov.uk/againsthumantrafficking and @ECATrafficking<br /> <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Gift box ","Trafficked victims ","Royal Borough","carnaby","ECAT ","From Friday 18 October to Sunday 20 October a giant walk-in gift box will be placed at the north end of Carnaby Street to help raise awareness of human trafficking in the capital.","Gift boxes help raise awareness of human trafficking in the capital "

Previously, councils were required to use the `flying motorbike&#39; sign that prohibits motor vehicles, but which few road users understood. By making appropriate one-way streets accessible to cyclists the Council aims to provide routes on quieter back streets where first-time or nervous cyclists will feel more comfortable riding.<br /><br />Opening up more one-way streets to two-way cycling is a cheap and efficient way to promote cycling. The scheme was piloted in the Royal Borough, but several other boroughs have taken advantage of the new flexibilities agreed by the DfT.  The Council is now planning the next set of one-way roads that could be converted to two-way operation for cycling, and will be consulting local residents shortly. <br /><br />Councillor Tim Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Transport, said: &#34;There are many one-way streets in the borough, and across London, that could be used safely for two-way cycling.<br /><br />&#34;These are quieter roads which could really help the less experienced cyclist to get around. It&#39;s a practical idea which requires no high-cost engineering solution.<br /><br />&#34;I am very pleased that our work to persuade the DfT has been recognised with this award.&#34; <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Cllr Coleridge ","cycling ",,,,"Pioneering work by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea to allow two-way cycling on one-way streets was recognised recently with the Council winning a prestigious National Transport Award in the Achievements in Cycling category.","Opening up one-way streets for two-way cycling wins national award"

Highlights include a reduction in the extent to which basements can extend into the garden, a restriction to a single storey and severe restrictions on basement developments under, or in the gardens, of listed buildings, or where a basement already exists.<br /><br />Before the new policies can be introduced by the Council, they need to be examined by the Government&#39;s Planning Inspector who will decide whether they are sound.  The Council is gathering extra evidence to oppose the developers&#39; claims and this means that the examination will take place later in 2014 than originally expected. Further details on the timetable will be announced in due course.<br /><br />Councillor Tim Coleridge, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said:<br /><br />&#34;Basements are a very lucrative business for developers and our plans have clearly struck a nerve.<br /><br />&#34;Residents have told us that we have got it right and council officers are gathering the evidence we need to make our case watertight.<br /><br />&#34;Over the past decade we&#39;ve noticed a dramatic increase in the number of basement applications and now is the time to ensure measures are brought in to introduce a sense of proportionality to basement development.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","basements ","councillor coleridge ","Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea ","Developers","Planning Inspector  ","The capital&#39;s biggest basement developers are attempting to derail the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s plans to control development below ground.","Developers attempt to derail Royal Borough&#39;s basement proposals"

The project will run for 12months.  Current figures suggest that the number of young people aged 16 to 19 who fall into this category in the borough is 157. <br /><br />The Clement James Centre will work with the young people to help them prepare CVs and develop employment skills with practice interviews, courses and workshops around timekeeping, communication, presentation and other employability skills. They will also have a day within a business to develop these skills in a real life setting.<br /><br />Youth Action Alliance will provide mentors and hands-on experience of working in an office environment in their own specialist training centre.  This will give young people, with little or no previous experience of what it is like to work in an office, a chance to try their hand at the tasks that any young job starter would expect to do.<br /><br />Direct work with young recruits and their employers will be undertaken by Spearhead.

Most plastic films and carrier bags can now be recycled at local supermarkets, and the public can recycle electrical items at the Civic Amenity Site, Smugglers Way, Wandsworth, SW18 1JS.<br /><br />The Council does not operate a collection for food waste or provide subsidised composters or wormeries, although the recycling team can provide help and advice to any resident on these matters. <br /><br />The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Environment, Environmental Health and Leisure, Councillor Tim Ahern said: &#34;Recycling contamination is a big problem. In recent months this has gone up, usually because people don&#39;t understand what goes in their bag or bank but, in a small minority of cases, because people don&#39;t care or realise how much it costs to the Council and taxpayers.<br /> <br />&#34;The current rate of contamination in recycling bags will cost the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea around £400,000 this year.&#34;<br /><br />If you would like to find out more about the campaign or speak to someone about recycling in the borough call Streetline 020 7361 3001 or email Streetline@rbkc.gov.uk<br /><br />For more information about what can and cannot be recycled visit www.rbkc.gov.uk/recycling<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Cllr Ahern ","Recycling ",,,,"Around 10,000 residents in Kensington and Chelsea will be advised about their recycling habits as part of a door knocking campaign to help people recycle responsibly and reduce contamination.","Residents get recycling advice"

"4587","11/11/2013 16:50:00","MAGIC WAND APPEAL SECURES SONOWAND SCANNER TO HELP BRAIN CANCER PATIENTS ","The first of two new high-tech ultrasound scanners which enable more accurate brain surgery has been installed at Charing Cross Hospital&#39;s neurosurgery centre, marking a significant step forward for brain cancer treatment in London.<br /><br />Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs Charing Cross Hospital, was able to purchase the equipment, costing £250,000 each, thanks to a fundraising drive by the charity Brain Tumour Research Campaign (BTRC) spearheaded by the former mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Cllr Christopher Buckmaster.<br /><br />Charing Cross Hospital is the first centre in the UK to have the latest model of the ground-breaking SonoWand mobile imaging equipment and is one of only two centres in the country to have an older model which has been in use since 2008. A second machine will be delivered to the hospital later this year. <br /><br />Councillor Christopher Buckmaster started his Magic Wand Appeal after a close friend was diagnosed with a brain tumour, he said: &#34;This is marvellous news and a fitting end to the campaign which began to increase public awareness of the desperate need for more funding for brain cancer treatment and to raise funds for research at Charing Cross Hospital and the purchase of the new machines. I am so proud of everyone&#39;s efforts.&#34;<br /><br />The new equipment, called SonoWand Invite, helps surgeons operate more accurately, safely and quickly by converting pre-operative MRI scans into a virtual 3D reconstruction of the brain. During the procedure surgeons are able to see rapidly updated images of the brain and brain movement (shift) in real time so that they can remove as much of a tumour as possible without damaging healthy tissue. This is done by utilising integrated finely tuned and calibrated ultrasound that creates 3D images of the brain and blood vessels with high resolution that can be merged with the MRI.<br /><br />This marks significant progress in the battle against brain cancer which causes more deaths in children and people under 40 every year than any other cancer. More than 800 Londoners are diagnosed with a brain, central nervous system or intracranial tumour every year while less than one per cent of cancer research funding goes to brain tumours. <br /><br />Mr Kevin O&#39;Neill, consultant neurosurgeon at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and co-founder of the charity BTRC, said: &#34;Accurately locating a tumour and safely removing it without damage to normal brain tissue and blood vessels is a real challenge for surgeons. The SonoWand makes surgery safer, more accurate and more of the tumour is removed so that what&#39;s left responds better to other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The new model is a major advance from the prototype and provides a platform to combine robotics and other technologies being developed at Charing Cross Hospital and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. <br /><br />&#34;This is great news for brain tumour patients in London and for our team here at Charing Cross Hospital. Early studies using this technology are showing that patient survival and outcomes are better. The new equipment could revolutionise brain surgery, translating into patients living longer and therefore having the opportunity to benefit from our further research.&#34; <br /><br />Sandra Stankovic, who lives in Ealing, was operated on by Mr O&#39;Neill using the older model of the SonoWand in July for a rare type of cancerous brain tumour. Using the SonoWand meant the tumour was removed and blood vessels supplying the tumour were destroyed without damage to nearby vessels supplying healthy tissue.<br /><br />Sandra is still in treatment to prevent the tumour from recurring although her last scan, a month ago, was clear. Sandra, a mother of two children, Leo aged seven and Lily aged five, and founder of an IT company, said: &#34;Using the SonoWand combined with Mr O&#39;Neill&#39;s exceptional skills meant the tumour was successfully removed and I am doing really well. The SonoWand meant the surgeon was not operating `blind&#39; on my brain and he could see the blood vessels in real time and navigate through them.&#34;<br /><br />Sandra has also been treated with anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy) at Charing Cross Hospital since the tumour was first diagnosed seven years ago. She added: <br />&#34;I can&#39;t stress enough how amazing my care is at Charing Cross Hospital - my surgeon Mr O&#39;Neill, my oncologist Dr Mark Glaser and the two oncology nurses, Shaun O&#39;Gara and Theresa Sage - are all  brilliant and I feel very safe in their hands. Now with the new SonoWand equipment, I believe the treatment will be even better.&#34; <br /><br />The Trust was able to purchase the new machines, which each cost £250,000, thanks to the charity fund-raising campaign by the BTRC, Cllr Buckmaster&#39;s Magic Wand Appeal and private donors in partnership with Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. <br /><br />BTRC co-founder Wendy Fulcher said: &#34;One of our main aims has been to establish Charing Cross Hospital as an international centre of excellence for neuro-oncology and the new equipment marks a major step towards achieving this aim.&#34; <br /><br />Alexandra Dixon, one of Mr O&#39;Neill&#39;s former patients, said: &#34;It is such exciting news that Charing Cross Hospital has the latest model. The machine provides excellent imaging in real time during surgery - and I was lucky enough to be the first patient in London to benefit from it.

I have spoken to many of the residents and their families, who are all genuinely happy to be here and having looking around for myself I am very impressed with the facilities offered.&#34;<br /><br />Cllr Fiona Buxton, the former Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care who approved the start of works, added: &#34;It is good news for everyone that we are able to offer people with complex needs the chance of independent living within the borough.  This means they do not lose contact with family and friends by having to move away, as well as allowing them to have the best standard of living and chances possible.<br /><br />&#34;When you consider that for many of the younger residents this will be their first time living away from their families and carers you will appreciate just how important it was for us to upgrade these facilities and give them a place to live that everyone associated with Piper House can be proud of.&#34;<br /><br />The work has seen Piper House converted from three, six-bed flats for people with learning disabilities, but lacking full access, into 12 flats, ten of which can be used by wheelchair users.  <br /><br />It follows the decision by the Council in 2008 to develop more local services for people with complex needs.

"4604","22/11/2013 13:52:00","SWEEPING REFORMS TO NEW TENANCIES IN KENSINGTON AND CHELSEA","People with genuine local connections and armed forces personnel will receive greater priority for council housing as part of a package of sweeping reforms to new tenancies in Kensington and Chelsea.<br /><br />The reforms, agreed by the Council&#39;s Cabinet last night (21 November 2013),following six months of public consultation and scrutiny, include measures that will transform not only who can get a Council home, but also on what terms.  <br /><br />Amongst the measures is an end to lifetime tenancies.  New tenants are already  issued with 12 month introductory tenancies.  But from 6 January 2014 a tenant who completes such a tenancy without breaching its terms will then be eligible for either a two or, more typically five-year tenancy.<br /><br />There would typically be a presumption to renew; however, tenancies would not be renewed if at the end of their term:<br /><br /> there has been a serious breach of the tenancy agreement including rent arrears or antisocial behaviour<br /> the tenant or tenant&#39;s partner has acquired a legal interest in another property suitable for occupation<br /> household income has grown to more than £50,000 for one and two-bed flats and £65,000 for larger properties<br /> savings and investments, other than for pension purposes, exceed £25,000.<br /> .<br />In addition, if the property has become too large for the household&#39;s needs, a new tenancy would only be offered on a smaller property, so that families trapped in overcrowded accommodation have a better chance of being allocated a home that meets their needs.<br /><br />As well as amending the terms of tenancies, the Council is also altering the rules on which households qualify for Council and Housing Association homes in the first place.  From 17 February 2014 people who have not been in the borough for at least three years will generally be disqualified. Extra points will be awarded to households where at least one member is in paid work for 16 hours a week or more.  Serving and former members of the armed forces and bereaved partners of forces personnel also attract extra points. Households with high incomes and significant savings will no longer be eligible for social-rented properties*, but will instead be able to access intermediate housing options, such as shared ownership or discount market rented properties.<br /><br />&#34;Our social housing is a scarce and precious resource,&#34; said Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen, the Council&#39;s Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Housing.  &#34;We have an absolute duty to make sure that it goes to the right people.  For us that means those in the greatest need, those with real roots in our borough, those who work and are good neighbours, and those who have served our country. Therefore, we are adjusting our policies accordingly.&#34;  <br /><br />As a corollary of the reforms, the Council intends to remove from its housing register those households with no realistic prospect of ever getting a Council or Housing Association home.  Last year the Council let 470 properties but it has nearly 9,000 households on its housing register, nearly 6,500 of which are neither homeless,  overcrowded or in pressing medical need.<br /><br />&#34;People are currently able to join our housing register that in fact have very low priority&#34;, explained Cllr Feilding-Mellen.  <br /><br /> &#34;It is better to offer them realistic housing advice about where they can find actual accommodation than to leave them languishing on a list for homes which will simply never become available because quite properly the homeless, the ill and the chronically overcrowded will always be ahead in the queue.&#34;<br /><br />These new tenancy policies form part of a wider set of planning and housing policy reforms intended to increase the supply of new housing of all tenures across the borough, but with a special focus on more housing for those who are ineligble for social housing but unable to afford private housing in the borough. Cllr Feilding-Mellen concluded, &#34;In order to protect and preserve our mixed community, we need to make sure there are more homes available for those hard-working households and families in the middle of the income spectrum, and so we will be looking at every opportunity to deliver more intermediate and mid-market housing here in Kensington and Chelsea&#34;.<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Housing policy ","tenancy ","Cllr Feilding-mellen ",,,"People with genuine local connections and armed forces personnel will receive greater priority for council housing as part of a package of sweeping reforms to new tenancies in Kensington and Chelsea.","Sweeping reforms to new tenancies in Kensington and Chelsea"

Tara Kennedy, Project Development Manager at the Dalgarno Centre said the project &#34;has exceeded our expectations in the success and change it has brought to those receiving coaching.&#34; <br /><br />Life coaching in St. Charles is being provided by the Clement James Centre. Eight St Charles Ward residents initially attended an induction at the centre in March 2013 and then received six sessions of one-hour coaching. Since then eight more people have benefited from the project.<br /><br />So far there have been positive results for those who have received life coaching including career changes, signing up for leadership courses and gaining new employment.  One person has even started up her own business as a life coach and is offering her services for free to other residents who feel they may benefit from it.<br /><br />The project is being funded for two years and 32 residents will have received coaching by the end. In addition to the coaching, the programme offers the opportunity for the coaches, and other local residents, to attend a two-day accredited life coaching course each year. <br /><br />Councillor Gerard Hargreaves, Cabinet Member for Voluntary Organisations and Resident Engagement, said: &#34;I am very pleased to hear that this life coaching project is making a positive difference to people&#39;s lives.&#34;<br /><br />Councillor Pat Healy, a St Charles ward Councillor said: &#34;I am delighted that the life coaching project has proved such a success, not just in helping the St Charles residents who have been through the process to begin to fulfil their own potential. But as we hoped, some of them are already giving back by using their experience to life coach others who might otherwise have fallen by the wayside.&#34;<br /><br />For more information, please contact Tara Kennedy at tara@dalgarnotrust.org.uk<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL",,,,,,"Life coaching is being increasingly explored as a way of tackling issues such as worklessness, loss of confidence, disengagement and family problems.

Rinse clean any glass bottle or jar, drinks can or food tin and place it in the recycling bag or recycling bank<br /> recycle plastic bottles, pots, tubs and trays - e.g. water, shampoo, bubble bath, milk, bleach, detergent, washing-up liquid bottles, yoghurt pots and ready meal trays. Please remove the lids, rinse clean and place into your recycling bag or recycling bank <br /> empty aerosol cans, without the lids, can also be recycled in recycling bags and banks.<br /><br />As much as £400,000 a year is wasted dealing with contaminated recycling at a cost to the Council and council tax payers.<br /><br />Last year residents recycled over 81 tonnes of Christmas trees for composting, so this year the Council is running the Christmas tree composting scheme again. <br /><br />From Thursday 2 to Wednesday 15 January 2014 the Council will collect Christmas trees to be shredded and turned into compost.<br /><br />Christmas tree collection dates are different to those for normal rubbish.

ITC Concepts Limited will be the main contractor and will oversee the works which include modernising the electrics and making it more comfortable for library users by installing a more energy-efficient heating and ventilation system.  Other details include new hot and cold water services, refurbishing the lifts and installing public toilets on the lower ground floor. Essential repairs to the roof will also be carried out.  <br /><br />Funding of £5.8m for the project was approved by the Royal Borough back in November 2012 and will ensure that the building can continue to meet the needs of the community for at least the next twenty years. The works will improve the overall use of space including creating new offices from previously underutilised areas, some of which will be available for the local business community to rent. <br /><br />Councillor Emma Will, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Libraries, said:<br /><br />&#34;These renovation works are essential if Kensington Central Library is to continue to meet the needs of the community for decades to come and is part of our ongoing commitment to the borough&#39;s libraries.&#34;<br /><br />Preliminary building work began in November 2013 in non-public areas of the library.  Between December 2013 and February 2014 access to the Biography Collection and music scores in the basement will be temporarily suspended and a small amount of some Local Studies material will also be unavailable.

It had previously pleaded guilty to one offence under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 and to another offence under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 at Hammersmith Magistrates Court on 15 October. The offences were found following an investigation by Environmental Health Officers from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea into the death of a woman swimming at a Virgin Active Club at 17a Old Court Place, Kensington, London W8. <br /><br />The court heard how on 3 December 2011 Miss Elsa Carneau (25) drowned whilst swimming in the pool at the club.<br /><br />Miss Carneau was not a club member but had previously used the facilities as a guest of a club member. On the day of the incident, Elsa Carneau was allowed to enter the club unaccompanied, despite this being against the club&#39;s rules, where she swam lengths. The swimming pool was not required to have lifeguards but was monitored by CCTV and physical poolside checks. However, the single CCTV camera, which was located at one end of the pool, failed to provide a clear view of the whole pool and did not cover the end of the pool where Elsa Carneau got into difficulty.  <br /><br />After some time, the other swimmers became concerned that she was underwater and not moving. Finding her unconscious, Elsa Carneau was lifted out of the pool but, sadly, attempts to resuscitate at poolside were unsuccessful.<br /> <br />The accident was investigated by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and serious shortcomings in the management of health and safety risks relating to swimming activities at the club were uncovered.<br /><br />Officers found that there had been a failure to undertake a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of the swimming pool. They discovered a failing to make proper arrangements for the effective planning, organisation, control and monitoring of the preventative and protective measures identified in Virgin Active&#39;s documentation and a failure to conduct the operation of the swimming pool in such a way as to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, that people were not exposed to risks whilst using the swimming pool.  The investigation also revealed that the required checks of the CCTV and physical checks of the poolside were not carried out on the day of the incident.  The CCTV checks were routinely not completed a month prior to the incident and the poolside checks were not carried out as per Virgin Active&#39;s procedure.<br /><br />Summing up His Honour Judge McCreath, Hon. Recorder of Westminster, highlighted that there was foreseeable risk and a serious breach of Virgin Active&#39;s duty and that there was evidence of inadequate supervision on the day.<br /><br />He also highlighted that the CCTV was defective in two significant ways in that it did not cover the whole pool and that the pictures to front of house lacked clarity.<br /><br />He also acknowledged that it was impossible to demonstrate corporate faults of Virgin Active causing this death and that strong arrangements and corporate structures were in place and that the company generally had a good safety record.<br /><br />Cllr Tim Ahern, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &#34;This was a very sad case for officers to investigate.

"4639","16/01/2014 10:09:00","£25M EXTRA FOR INVESTMENT IN COUNCIL HOMES","The money available to repair and improve council homes is expected to soar by £25m over the next five years, thanks to a series of measures contained in the housing budget  discussed last night (Wednesday 16 January) at the Tenant Consultative Committee<br /> <br />In 2012 councils became subject to a new self-financing regime in which they support and maintain their housing stock purely from their own rental income and other resources. In Kensington and Chelsea, that greater freedom and autonomy is having a positive budgetary effect.<br /><br />Crucially, increases in rental income are no longer handed to central Government&#39;s redistributive housing subsidy system but are instead retained locally.<br /> <br />Since 2002 council rents have been calculated using a complex national formula. For each property, a target rent is set and the expectation is that over time the rent charged moves towards the target rent. However, the rate at which they can do so has been severely limited.<br /><br />Currently just one per cent of the Council&#39;s housing stock has reached the target rent indicated by the national formula.  Using the greater freedoms under the new finance regime, the Council is accelerating the pace of convergence so that all rents reach target by 2018-19.  <br /><br />In 2014-15 rents will therefore increase by an average of 6.26 per cent, which is just one per cent more than would have been the case under the old regime.  Even so, that additional increase will generate an extra £7 million over five years while the average Council rent in Kensington and Chelsea will still be just £118.29 per week, which is just a fraction of the market rate.<br /><br />But it&#39;s not all about rent.  The end of the annual uncertainty over the level of subsidy enables stable financial and business planning.  Against that background, a range of savings and initiatives are being realised.  For example, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) performance has increased markedly across a range of measures but its management fees have not, empty flats are being let quickly and efficiently to maintain rental income and KCTMO is also beginning to better exploit the potential of community centres and estate parking to support investment in people&#39;s homes.<br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s no secret that we are in an age of austerity,&#34; said the Deputy Leader of the Council, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen, &#34;so it&#39;s excellent news that we&#39;ll be able to invest £60m - that&#39;s an additional £25m than previously planned - in our estate over the next five years.  All of that extra money will be coming back to our tenants in the form of better repairs, maintenance and other services, and we&#39;ll be doing that at the same time as putting protections in place to ensure no tenants suffer excessive rent increases.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Cllr Feilding-Mellen ",,,,,"The money available to repair and improve council homes is expected to soar by £25m over the next five years, thanks to a series of measures contained in the housing budget  discussed last night (Wednesday 16 January) at the Tenant Consultative Committee","£25m extra for investment in Council homes"

As an independent body the service is now a PSM with its 152 staff owning shares in the company and having a say in its management.  Its new mutual status will also enable Epic to market itself to other organisations. <br />  <br />Although legally separated, it will continue to provide the Royal Borough with first-class services and has signed a five year contract to do so.  <br /><br />Epic currently operates four youth centres and is working out of several sites run by the voluntary sector, as well as directly with the community.  Amongst other roles, it provides guidance and support for 13 to 19-year-olds and particularly those in difficulty.  That guidance and support takes many forms including intensive one-to-one work, arts, sport, health, education and experiencing the great outdoors.  <br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said:<br /><br />&#34;Councils up and down the country have had to make very difficult decisions, resulting from a growing need for high quality support for young people combined with reduced public expenditure. <br /><br />&#34;To ensure that our nationally recognised youth service does not suffer, we decided to pursue a different approach so that Epic CIC can grow and share its skills and experience with other organisations.&#34;<br /><br />Francis Maude MP, Minister for the Cabinet Office said:<br /><br />&#34;This Government is committed to improving the UK&#39;s public services and confronting the combined challenge of reduced public expenditure, rising customer demand, and increased service complexity.<br /> <br />&#34;Hard working taxpayers expect nothing less, and to meet these challenges we need to break down the old binary choice between in-house and outsourced delivery and establish more innovative models for delivering services.<br /><br />&#34;That&#39;s why we are supporting new mutuals and I hope that Epic CIC can inspire staff in other youth services by demonstrating that increased autonomy and freedom can achieve great results.&#34;<br /><br />Brendan O&#39;Keefe, who heads up Epic CIC, said:<br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s been a long journey to get to this point and we have taken the time to ensure that everything is in place so that we can successfully stand on our own two feet from day one.<br /><br />&#34;Epic&#39;s staff are very excited about what 2014 will bring and we look forward to going from strength-to-strength with the support of the Royal Borough.&#34; <br /><br />Back in July 2012 the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet agreed that the employees of the Youth Service will leave the Council and become an independent body.  For many months the Royal Borough has been supporting and advising the service employees as it finalises its business plan and puts the necessary operational structures in place.<br /><br />As well as continuing to provide services to Kensington and Chelsea, the PSM will market itself to other bodies, something it is already doing with some success.

"4644","22/01/2014 12:12:00","PLANNING PERMISSION FOR TWO MAJOR COUNCIL SITES","An unattractive and underused municipal car park in Young Street, Kensington, is to be replaced by a twenty-first century mansion block, the Council&#39;s Major Planning Development Committee agreed last night (21 January 2014).<br /><br />Of the 53 market homes in the new block, approximately 17 will be for sale, with the remainder for private rent.  The income will be shared between the Council and its development partner, Grainger.<br /><br />Standing at the northern entrance to historic Kensington Square, the car park at 19-27 Young Street is something of an eyesore.  The new development is an opportunity to dramatically improve the approach to the square, which is not only one of the oldest in London, but also one of the most desirable.  <br /><br />Built to an exacting specification, the mansion block will complement the square&#39;s dominant architectural styles and materials.  The expectation is that it will also yield a significant new income stream to support Council services.  <br /><br />&#34;This is a dated and ugly car park, which we can easily do without,&#34; said the Council&#39;s Cabinet Member for Housing, Property and Regeneration, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen.  &#34;Replacing it will be a fine building, far more appropriate to this important location.   And if that wasn&#39;t justification enough, there will also be rental income and some badly needed affordable four-bedroom houses provided offsite at Hortensia Road.&#34;<br /><br />Also before the committee last night was the related development of land on Hortensia Road.

As an independent body the service is now a PSM with its 152 staff owning shares in the company and having a say in its management.  Its new mutual status will also enable Epic to market itself to other organisations. <br />  <br />Although legally separated, it will continue to provide the Royal Borough with first-class services and has signed a five year contract to do so.  <br /><br />Epic currently operates four youth centres and is working out of several sites run by the voluntary sector, as well as directly with the community.  Amongst other roles, it provides guidance and support for 13 to 19-year-olds and particularly those in difficulty.  That guidance and support takes many forms including intensive one-to-one work, arts, sport, health, education and experiencing the great outdoors.  <br /><br />Nick Hurd MP, Minister for Civil Society, said:<br /><br />&#34;The entire public sector faces the challenges of reduced expenditure and rising customer demand. To meet these challenges, the Government is transforming the way services are delivered by creating an alternative to the old choice of in-house and outsourced delivery.<br /><br />&#34;We are supporting public service mutuals because we know that letting entrepreneurial front-line staff take ownership of their services results in greater innovation, efficiency, and improved outcomes for young people and communities.<br /><br />&#34;I wish Epic CIC success for the future and I hope they can inspire staff in other youth services to follow their lead and reap the benefits.&#34; <br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Services, said:<br /><br />&#34;Councils up and down the country have had to make very difficult decisions, resulting from a growing need for high quality support for young people combined with reduced public expenditure. <br /><br />&#34;To ensure that our nationally recognised youth service does not suffer, we decided to pursue a different approach so that Epic CIC can grow and share its skills and experience with other organisations.&#34;<br /><br />Brendan O&#39;Keefe, who heads up Epic CIC, said:<br /><br />&#34;It&#39;s been a long journey to get to this point and we have taken the time to ensure that everything is in place so that we can successfully stand on our own two feet from day one.<br /><br />&#34;Epic&#39;s staff are very excited about what 2014 will bring and we look forward to going from strength-to-strength with the support of the Royal Borough.<br /><br />We are enormously grateful to our friends and colleagues in the Cabinet Office Mutuals Support Programme for their support and guidance during the creation of Epic. I am also delighted to have been named as a Cabinet Office Mutuals Ambassador, and will happily work with the Cabinet Office team to encourage the growth of new mutuals in the youth sector.&#34; <br /><br />Back in July 2012 the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet agreed that the employees of the Youth Service will leave the Council and become an independent body.  For many months the Royal Borough has been supporting and advising the service employees as it finalises its business plan and puts the necessary operational structures in place.<br /><br />As well as continuing to provide services to Kensington and Chelsea, the PSM will market itself to other bodies, something it is already doing with some success.

After several adjournments the case was heard. <br /> <br />Commenting on the sentence, Councillor Rock Feilding-Mellen, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Housing, said: &#34;This property was not in a fit and proper state to provide safe accommodation for its residents so it was right that we took this action.

This means action must be taken now to ensure residents have access to the most suitable services to enable them and their carers to remain healthy in the community, reduce hospital admissions and the need for costly long-term residential care.<br /><br />Cabinet agreed last night (Monday 24 February) to enter into a lease agreement with Central North West London NHS Trust (CNWL) to provide dementia services from the ground floor of Chamberlain House at the St Charles Centre for Health and Wellbeing in North Kensington.<br /><br />At present, day services for older people with dementia are delivered from the Miranda Barry Centre in Ellesmere House.  It is acknowledged as a well-managed and popular centre offering a range of activities ranging from arts and crafts to movement sessions.  However, its location and layout means what can be done in years to come will be restricted necessitating the need to look for a more suitable building which can accommodate a range of integrated health and social care services for people with dementia, their families and carers.<br /><br />The way day services will be delivered in the future will need to change and move to a hub model. This will provide a range of centre-based and non-centre support including provision of information and advice, person-centred support planning, flexible transport throughout the day, flexible opening hours and a cafe-style approach to nutritious meals.<br /><br />While it will not be possible for the Miranda Barry Centre to meet these requirements they can be met at Chamberlain House.  The former day hospital is ideally suited to providing day services to older people and offers the space, layout, security and accessibility required of a specialist dementia resource centre.  Furthermore, CNWL&#39;s Community Mental Health Team is based on the St Charles site, so it is anticipated that moving to this site will lead to improved links between statutory health and social care services.<br /><br />Age UK Kensington &#38; Chelsea has already expressed an interest in using the proposed dementia resource centre as an additional venue for its Memory Cafe sessions as well as carers&#39; support groups and a range of stimulating activities.  The centre would create a one-stop service enabling people with dementia and their carers to access sources of practical help and advice.  <br /><br />A full refurbishment of the ground floor of Chamberlain House is planned and it is anticipated that the new facilities would be ready to open in May 2014.<br /><br />Councillor Mary Weale, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care and Public Health, said: &#34;Dementia is a debilitating condition and unfortunately the number of people who will be affected by it in the borough in years to come is set to rise.  <br /><br />&#34;This means we have to plan ahead to make sure we are offering the best day services we can and integrating this with the health service and the voluntary sector.<br /><br />&#34;The reality is that we will not be able to meet the challenges ahead of us from the Miranda Barry Centre, excellent though its services have been.<br /><br />&#34;What we will do however is to take the expertise we have built up and improve on it at Chamberlain House.&#34;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Cllr mary weale ","  dementia",,,,"Vital services for people with dementia are to be relocated to more flexible premises at St Charles Centre in North Kensington in order to meet demand and improve the range of services on offer.","Planning for the future of dementia care services"

It supports residents to arrange trips, tea parties and an annual Christmas party as well as publishing a regular newsletter. <br /><br />Silchester Estate Residents&#39; Association has worked to tackle issues such as overcrowding, isolation and antisocial behaviour.  It also organises a very popular summer event on the estate which is eagerly anticipated and attended by more than 200 residents.<br /><br />Nevern Square Conservation Area Residents&#39; Association has run a series of events to foster a sense of community and belonging to help tackle problems such as social isolation.  It has also conducted a wide survey to find out the views of people who lived within the Nevern Square Conservation Area including what they like and dislike about the area, views on policing, drugs, crime, traffic and local planning issues. <br /><br />All three associations received a one-off grant of £500.<br /><br />The evening provided an excellent opportunity to share good news stories and appreciation to those residents and community groups which have supported or benefited from the Council&#39;s City Living, Local Life (CLLL) initiative.  The programme aims to encourage and help residents work with their local ward Councillors to develop practical projects on local issues or ideas.  <br /><br />The initiative, now in its second year, allocates up to £20,000 each year to each ward to support Councillors&#39; work with a range of partners including residents, voluntary and community organisations and local businesses to make life better for residents.<br /><br />Over 141 initiatives are working towards:<br /><br /> improving employability and people&#39;s life chances<br /> tackling isolation amongst older people in the community<br /> improving the street scene and local environment<br /> increasing access to cultural opportunities and encouraging a sense of local identity<br /> promoting volunteering and community participation <br /><br />Councillor Gerard Hargreaves, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Voluntary Organisations and Resident Engagement, said: &#34;I am delighted that we were able to recognise the efforts of those resident and tenant associations that work so hard to make their community a better place to live in.<br /><br />&#34;We can see just what a difference this type of local initiative can have on the ground and that&#39;s why our City Living Local Life programme will continue to support community-based work at a ward level.  It&#39;s also why I am so pleased that we have been able to maintain levels of Council funding to community and voluntary groups whose work makes this borough such a wonderful place to live.<br /><br />&#34;I would like to thank the Mayor for hosting this reception and I know his hospitality was greatly appreciated by all who attended.&#34;<br /><br />Speaking about the evening, the Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, said: &#34;My congratulations to tonight&#39;s Gold Standard Award winners.

As part of a wide ranging package of measures, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has frozen PCSO recruitment.  With PCSOs leaving the service through natural wastage or becoming constables, the number available across London and to Kensington and Chelsea has been declining.<br /><br />At the same time the MPS has, for the first time, extended to Kensington and Chelsea a scheme enabling councils to buy police officers who have a more extensive range of powers than PCSOs.   <br /><br />The real cost of a police constable is £65,000 a year but the Mayor&#39;s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) is currently offering a buy one get one free.  In other words, it will cost £32,500 a year to acquire the services of a constable, which is roughly equivalent to the price of buying a PCSO.  <br /><br />With PCSO numbers in decline, the Council believes it can achieve a bigger impact on crime and fear of crime by reinvesting in police constables who have a much greater range of powers than PCSOs.<br /><br />&#34;Financially speaking these are difficult times, but, as a Conservative Council, we are committed to investing in security for our residents and, with this switch from PCSOs to PCs, achieving a higher return on our money,&#34; said Cllr Joanna Gardner, Cabinet Member for Community Safety, IT and Corporate Services. &#34;The new team will be able to respond to some of those local issues which aren&#39;t usually a priority for police, but do concern our residents and affect their lives.<br /><br />&#34;These officers will operate as part of a Council tasked team on problems which are important to our residents and businesses alike.  As they have a full range of powers, including arrest, they will be able to operate across a much broader range of policing challenges.  <br /><br />&#34;All the evidence says that our investment in PCSOs has been a success, particularly when it comes to providing a visible policing presence, but PCSO numbers are going into decline and we now have an opportunity to reinvest in full police officers and a different way of working.&#34;<br /><br />The first members of the New Kensington and Chelsea Community Policing Team will be on the streets of Kensington and Chelsea by late summer 2014. <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Kensington and Chelsea ","Community Policing Team",,,,"An extra 41 police officers will be on the streets of Kensington and Chelsea next year and they will be focussing solely on those issues of greatest concern to residents.","Council pays for 41 new police officers"

And in addition they will receive a one-off £100 rebate, thanks to an overachieving efficiency drive. <br /><br />Equivalent to a nine per cent reduction at band D (six per cent at band G), the efficiency dividend will cost about £7.5 million. *<br /><br />It&#39;s been made possible thanks to the success of the Council&#39;s extensive cost reduction programme.  From 2010 Kensington and Chelsea committed to a demanding programme of savings, more than matching a loss of grants to the Council from central Government as Ministers sought to reduce the public sector deficit.  <br /><br />The Royal Borough&#39;s challenge has been to plug that financial gap without  damaging its high-quality services.**  It has met that challenge by helping to pioneer the most radical service sharing arrangement in Britain.***  In addition it has been transforming the way it manages its valuable property estate and improving efficiency in many other ways.<br /><br />So successful has that cost reduction programme been that it has exceeded its savings targets for 2013-14, thereby producing a surplus.  But with austerity likely to be prolonged well beyond 2014, that one-off surplus can&#39;t be ploughed back into services on any sustainable basis.  The Cabinet has therefore decided to hand the money back to its taxpayers as a one-off efficiency dividend.<br /><br />&#34;Although at times it has been painful and difficult,&#34; said Council Leader, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown, &#34;we have done a good job of bringing down costs while protecting our high-quality services. <br /><br />&#34;As a result we now find ourselves with a little left in the tank.  In deciding what to do with it, we think it is wrong to discount from our calculations those whose money this was in the first place.<br /><br />&#34;Services require annual recurrent spending.  As this is a one-off surplus the right place for it is with our residents.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks to the cashback and the continuing freeze in council tax - which began in 2010/11 - residents in bands E to H will be paying less council tax in 2014-15 than they were in 2001 when allowance is made for inflation.  Residents in bands A to D will be paying less than in 2000.****<br /><br />As well as setting the council tax and ordering the dividend, the Cabinet last night agreed full revenue and capital budgets for 2014-15.  Both can be read online at www.rbkc.gov.uk<br /><br />The savings and efficiencies described in the revenue budget will enable the Council to avoid any significant service reduction compared with 2013-14.<br /> <br />Despite the continuing financial pressures, strong reserves carefully built up over many years will allow the Council to continue to be ambitious for the Royal Borough.  For example, work is well underway on the new £57.8 million academy and leisure centre for North Kensington, two thirds of which will be met directly from the Council&#39;s own coffers.  A new Middle Row primary school and a new children&#39;s home at East Row are also under construction. <br /> <br />&#34;We have so far managed to find our way through these difficult times while maintaining excellent local services,&#34; added Cllr Nick Paget-Brown.<br /> <br />&#34;We are very proud of that and equally proud that we are still able to pursue our ambitions to regenerate our borough.&#34;<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","council tax ","Cllr paget-brown ",,,,"Royal Borough council taxpayers will have their council tax frozen for the fifth year in a row, following a Kensington and Chelsea Cabinet decision last night (Monday 24 February).

It aims to reduce reoffending by women by ten per cent over two years.<br /><br />Councillor Joanna Gardner, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Community Safety, IT and Corporate Services, said: &#34;International Women&#39;s Day is an ideal opportunity to highlight the issues of female reoffenders and what can be done to offer them support.  The evidence is that ADVANCE Minerva is effective and therefore we will continue to offer help to women as they prepare to leave prison and re-enter society.&#34;<br /><br />Westminster City Council Cabinet Member for Community Protection, Councillor Nickie Aiken, said:  &#34;ADVANCE Minerva sets out to reduce reoffending among women through support and advocacy, addressing women&#39;s complex needs. There is a focus on building basic life skills - helping women to become less dependent on benefits or criminal behaviour, relying instead on their skills and employment. In short, women are given both the opportunity and support to make positive changes in their lives.&#34;   <br /><br />Nationally, it has been recognised that short-sentenced prisoners are disproportionately likely to reoffend. They have a significant impact on local communities, committing offences that are highly visible to our residents, such as theft, motoring offences and burglary. The Royal Borough and Westminster have been working with other boroughs to design services to support and rehabilitate short-sentenced prisoners from prison into the community, funded with support by the Mayor&#39;s Office for Policing and Crime and the Tri-borough Public Health department.<br /><br />Proportionately more women than men are sentenced to short prison sentences: 59 per cent of women offenders receive sentences of under six-months but even these sentences have far-reaching social and financial implications. Across the country, it is estimated that more than 17,240 children were separated from their mothers in 2010 by imprisonment. <br /><br />The Government&#39;s `Transforming Rehabilitation&#39; agenda will mean that management of offenders will be extended to short-sentenced prisoners.   The Tri-borough councils are supportive of the Government&#39;s shift to provide targeted rehabilitation to a cohort that has long been overlooked and who have a reoffending rate of over 50 per cent. Transforming Rehabilitation will see Community Rehabilitation Companies manage short-sentenced prisoners, on a payment-by-results basis. <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cllr  buckmaster","cllr aiken","reoffending","Community Safety",,"Marking International Women&#39;s Day, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and City of Westminster councils are highlighting the work of a project helping reoffenders to break the cycle and build a new life.","Helping women reoffenders break the cycle"

The Classic is a race for 150 professional riders.<br /><br />The route enters the borough in Knightsbridge and travels along the route of the A4 before entering Hammersmith and Fulham.  Cyclists will then come back into the borough via King&#39;s Road, Ashburnham Road, Cremorne Road, Cheyne Walk and Chelsea Embankment before an exciting finish on The Mall.<br /><br />Closing 100 miles of roads and bridges inevitably has a major impact on traffic, public transport and parking.  It is not just the roads that the cyclists ride along that will be affected.  Many other local roads will be closed to traffic from the early hours of Sunday 10 August to allow the event to pass safely through the borough.<br /><br />TfL and Prudential RideLondon will be publicising more details of the route, road closures, impact on public transport and where to get further information on their websites. A map of the route is available at www.prudentialridelondon.co.uk<br /><br />Councillor Tim Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Transport, said: &#34;Our experience from last year&#39;s event suggests that major disruption is inevitable.

It is only when they arrive at their destination that the true horror of what awaits them becomes apparent. <br /> <br />Members of the public are invited to walk into the GIFT box and read first-hand accounts from victims as part of the European Communities Against Trafficking (ECAT) Project.

A survey was carried out which identified materials which contained asbestos and gave some guidance on how to manage them safely.<br /><br />The hostel was inspected again, 18 months later, in the run-up to the 2012 Olympic Games in an attempt to ensure low-performing hotels were meeting health and safety standards.  The inspecting EHO asked about the asbestos containing materials and was told that they had been removed.  When he requested to see the paperwork he was told that there was none available.<br /><br />A subsequent inspection revealed that fireplace panels, which had contained asbestos, had been removed by an unlicensed contractor without the proper controls to ensure the safety of the contractor, guests and employees put in place.<br /><br />Officers from the Council&#39;s Environmental Health department found evidence of asbestos containing debris and dust in six rooms. Immediate notices were served on the owners prohibiting the use of the rooms until they could be decontaminated by a licensed contractor.  This was acted upon by Drewhaven Limited and once the work was completed permission was given for the rooms to be used again.<br /><br />An investigation was then launched by the Council to determine who was responsible for the breaches of the regulations.<br /><br />The court heard that Drewhaven Ltd had attended interviews at the Council&#39;s Environmental Health department voluntarily and had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.  However, Judge Zoe Smith pointed out that there had been a high degree of negligence which meant guests were put at significant risk for eight weeks.<br /><br /><br /><br />End<br /><br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL",,,,,,"A company that failed to comply with health and safety regulations regarding the removal of asbestos from a hostel it owned in Queensbury Place, SW7, was fined  £39,000 (Monday 7 April) at Isleworth Crown Court and ordered to pay the Council&#39;s costs of £12,299.75 and a victim surcharge of £120.","Hostel fined £39,000 for breach of asbestos regulations"

However, following a National Fraud Initiative referral, Council investigation officers established that she had failed to declare that she was employed in a nursery by the London Borough of Camden on a full-time basis since 2007; making her claim false from the outset. <br /><br />Miss Djalo-Seidi pleaded guilty to four charges of benefit fraud under s111A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and three counts of benefit fraud under s3 of the Fraud Act 2066.  In mitigation she stated that the extra money had been sent to her sick family in Africa.  She was sentenced to six months in prison for each charge, to run concurrently and after three months she will be released on licence for the remaining three months of her sentence.  A custodial sentence was given as a result of her receiving a caution for the same type of offence two years earlier.<br /><br />In sentencing Djalo-Seidi the bench stated:  &#34;We have looked at these offences .... and have decided that they are so serious only custody is appropriate.

But nationally the Citizens Advice Bureau has calculated up to four million people could be scammed each year as many scams go unreported.<br /><br />People are just as likely to be conned over the phone and via text messages as they are through emails and websites. New analysis reveals:<br /> over a third of scams (34 per cent) were over the phone<br /> almost a quarter of scams (24 per cent) were through visits to a website<br /> 16 per cent were letter or fax scams<br /> one in ten scams (ten per cent) is via emails<br /> <br />The Royal Borough&#39;s Trading Standards team is also warning people to watch out for unsecure websites that ask for financial details, as well as realising that scammers use the phone and email to carry out fraud, and can turn up on your doorstep.<br /> <br />Top tips for dealing with scams  <br />1. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is.<br />2. Never give out your bank details or send money unless you are certain you can trust the person contacting you.<br />3. Contacted out of the blue? Be suspicious.<br />4. Your bank and the police will never collect your bank card, ask for your PIN or come to your home.<br />5. Make sure the website&#39;s secure, if you are buying online - check for the padlock or &#39;https&#39; next to the web address<br />6. It you haven&#39;t bought a ticket, you can&#39;t win it.<br />7. You shouldn&#39;t have to pay anything to get a prize.<br />8. Pressure to make a decision straight away? Take your time and just say: &#34;No thank you&#34;.<br />9. Walk away from job ads that ask for money in advance.<br />10. Computer firms do not make unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer.<br />11.

Tell the caller you are not interested and take the time to do some research and speak to friends and family before making a decision.<br /><br />This is just what a Royal Borough resident did recently when called by a company using scare tactics.  The company told her that police in the area no longer have to attend calls regarding burglaries, this is untrue, police will continue to respond to any calls of criminal activity. They encouraged her to arrange an appointment at her home with a representative from the company to see a demonstration of how the company&#39;s `direct police call system&#39; works. On this occasion the resident did the right thing and took the caller&#39;s name and details and reported it to the Council; Trading Standards officers are now looking into the matter<br /><br />Often, the aim of these telephone calls is to gain access to your home, and use hard sell tactics to encourage you to buy unwanted goods or services. <br /><br />Remember you can say no, and if you do agree to anything over the telephone or at home then you have cancellation rights if you change your mind. <br /><br />For further advice about your rights, or to report hard sell or scare tactics contact Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 08454 040506 or visit www.adviceguide.org.uk<br /><br />May is Scams Awareness Month, visit www.citizensadvice.org.uk/sam14 to check how scam aware you are.

Over time its tables have become worn and rickety, making them unsuitable to use.<br /><br />Peter Doyle, Chairman of the Balfour of Burleigh Residents Association, said: &#34;The tables in the clubroom had become wobbly after years of use and did not feel safe. Goldfinger said they could keep the table tops and replace the legs with safer and stronger ones. <br /><br />&#34;The safer tables mean the clubroom can be used for more community functions. <br /><br />&#34;Goldfinger is a local company that we were keen to work alongside, and for them to offer their expertise for this community resource.  We hope that local residents might also wish to get involved in future projects and learn worthwhile skills in upcycling.&#34;<br /><br />Through City Living, Local Life, the Dalgarno ward Councillors funded this project to ensure the club room could continue to be used by the local community.  Councillor Pat Healy said: &#34;This was not just a case of repairing some tables in a popular community facility.

Our streets are congested and our air quality is poor.  A Crossrail station would make a massive difference so it&#39;s worrying at this late stage to see an option there that bypasses Chelsea altogether.  We urge as many residents as possible to get involved in the consultation and demand our station.&#34;<br /><br />The Council has long supported the idea of a new rail line connecting south-west and north-east London and last year it checked to make sure that the people of Chelsea agreed.<br /><br />About 3,000 Chelsea residents and businesses replied to the Council&#39;s survey, with around 70 per cent expressing support for the new line and a station in Chelsea.<br /><br />There was more support than opposition right across the survey area, although support was particularly high to the west.  And while there was strong support for a station at the Chelsea Fire Station site on Dovehouse Street, opinion was divided almost equally between those who felt this was the best location and those who thought it might be better placed further west.  <br /><br />The Council itself accepts that more residents would benefit if the western option were chosen but believes either of the King&#39;s Road options would bring very significant benefits.<br /><br />Crossrail 2 would relieve pressure on major London stations such as Euston, Victoria and Clapham Junction and ease congestion on very busy Tube lines. In some cases, journey times could be more than halved.<br /><br />The line would pass deep under Chelsea and a station on the King&#39;s Road would, among other things, link residents to Clapham Junction, the West End and four of London&#39;s busiest mainline stations.<br /><br />The idea for Crossrail 2 - formerly called the Chelsea- Hackney Line - has been around for many decades, with the Chelsea Fire Station having long been earmarked as a potential site for the station.<br /><br />Parts of Chelsea remain poorly served by public transport and the Council believes the line would:<br /><br /> dramatically improve local transport options<br /><br /> relieve local and city-wide congestion<br /><br /> ease pressure on the transport network<br /><br /> improve air quality<br /><br /> dramatically improve journey times<br /><br /> help the hard-pressed retail sector<br /><br /><br />As part of the consultation TfL will be running the following drop-in sessions:     <br /><br />Chelsea Theatre Studio 2, 7 World&#39;s End Place, King&#39;s Road, London, SW10 0DR<br />Friday 20 June, 10am to 4pm<br />Friday 27 June, 2pm to 8pm<br /><br />Chelsea Old Town Hall Small Hall, King&#39;s Road, London, SW3 5EE<br />Friday 11 July, 2pm to 8pm<br />Saturday 12 July, 10am to 4pm<br /><br />Residents can also participate online at www.crossrail2.co.uk<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Crossrail","King&#39;s Road","station","consultation","cllr coleridge","As TfL launches the last phase of its consultation on the route for Crossrail 2, the Council is urging local residents to help make sure the line stops at Chelsea.","TfL consults on latest Crossrail 2 options - a station for Chelsea "

Planners investigated and found that the transportation of materials from the site were not in line with the planning condition and warned the developer that legal action would be taken if they continued to breach the CTMP.  This warning was not heeded so the Royal Borough&#39;s Planning Enforcement Team issued a Breach of Condition notice on 23 May 2014.  This notice gives the developer 28 days to comply with the CTMP, after which any breach would be a criminal offence.<br /> <br />Despite this, the developer continued to breach the CTMP leading to the Council issuing a Temporary Stop Notice to the developer and owner of the property on 11 June. This means that, although works can continue, any further breaches of the CTMP will be a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of £20,000 in a magistrates court and unlimited if heard in a crown court.<br /> <br />Cllr Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: &#34;Conditions were placed on the traffic movements when planning permission was granted for this development.

However, the Council argued that the development could provide a surplus of over £1 million towards the provision of social housing.  <br /> <br />Dismissing the appeal Ms Graham found that payment of £200,000 would fall a long way short of the &#34;maximum reasonable amount&#34; that could be contributed toward affordable housing.  <br /> <br />The Inspector agreed with the Council that some of the key assumptions in the developer&#39;s financial viability statement were wrongly balanced in its favour to reduce the funding available for affordable housing, including interest rates, necessary profit, contingency costs and land valuation.  She said: &#34;there remains an identified surplus of over £1 million, which could contribute toward the provision of affordable housing in the borough. I regard this figure as more indicative of the maximum reasonable amount.&#34;<br /> <br />Welcoming the decision the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, Cllr Timothy Coleridge, said: &#34;This decision supports the Council&#39;s rigorous approach.

He faces 15 months in prison if he fails to pay the confiscation order in three months.<br /><br />On 10 June Mr Mayur Naturbhai Patel pleaded guilty to breaching the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 after he made major rooftop alterations to his Portland Road property without planning permission and did not comply with a Council enforcement notice requiring them to be removed.<br /><br />Sentencing was referred to Isleworth Crown Court as it has the power to deal with a proceeds of crime action instigated by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea which wanted to prevent Mr Patel profiting financially from the additional floor space created by his illegal development.<br /><br />At his original hearing on 10 June, magistrates heard how Mr Patel, currently of Academy Place, Isleworth, failed to comply with a planning enforcement notice served by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in November 2012.  <br /><br />Enforcement officers issued the notice following complaints that major work was underway at 104 Portland Road in W11.  On inspection they discovered that the roof had been altered and that a large roof extension and a rear roof had been constructed, all of which is unauthorised development harming the appearance of the Norland Conservation Area in which Portland Road stands.  <br /><br />Despite the four months allowed under the notice to restore the property, and a number of reminders, most of the work required remains outstanding to this day, but still needs to be undertaken to avoid potential further action by the Council.  <br /><br />In his defence Mr Patel claimed to have received verbal confirmation from his architect and a planning officer that the alterations would be acceptable.  Mr Patel has no previous convictions.<br /><br />In his closing remarks His Honour Judge Phillip Matthews said he did not ascribe shady motives when imposing the financial penalty, but thought Mr Patel had acted with the &#34;utmost stupidity&#34; and that it was no mitigation to say he relied on the advice of architects. <br /><br />Councillor Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: &#34;I am very pleased that the court has made this ruling.

It is the second year that cows are being used in this way. Last year two other cows from the same herd spent six weeks in the park and previously pigs were used during the summer months to graze the area.<br /><br />Longhorns are one of the oldest and largest of the British native breeds and are renowned for their docility, strong maternal instincts and rough grazing abilities. Where other cattle would turn up their noses the Longhorn digs in: nettles, diverse grasses, wild flowers and thistles, it eats them all. <br /><br />Cabinet Member for the Environment, Cllr Tim Ahern, said: &#34;We are delighted to welcome Jelly and Lulu to Holland Park where they will go straight to work grazing in the conservation area.  The cows did great work in record time last year and we are expecting a similar performance this year. It is all part of the work the Ecology Service does to enhance biodiversity in the borough.&#34;<br /> <br />The Longhorns will arrive in Holland Park on Monday 14 July and will remain for three weeks. Originally used as oxen to plough the land the Longhorn rose to fame as a superior beef animal in the 1700s but in the early 1900s the breed fell out of favour.<br /><br />The modern rise of the Longhorns is attributed to a change in farming methods with some farmers preferring a less intensive rearing and grazing system in which the slow maturing and more maternal breeds rule supreme.<br /><br />If anyone would like to find out more about the use of cattle in conservation grazing there is a talk on 23 July 2014 at 6.30pm meet by Lord Holland&#39;s statue.

Planners warned the developer that legal action would be taken if they continued to breach the CTMP. This warning was not heeded so the Council&#39;s Planning Enforcement Team issued both a Breach of Condition Notice and a Temporary Stop Notice on both companies on the 16 July 2014.

The proposals would also result in community play projects being managed by third sector providers from April 2015, lifting the Council&#39;s management burden and protecting valuable front line play services.<br /><br />Between 2010 and 2014 Government funding for Children&#39;s Services fell by £12.3m - approximately a third.  As a big spending department the Council&#39;s Play Service is inevitably affected. <br /><br />These plans would yield the greatest levels of savings for the Council (over £1.3 million in the first three years), whilst preserving a comprehensive childcare offer for working parents and at the same time protecting community play projects.  Up and down the country only a very small minority of local authorities provide play and childcare services directly.  <br /><br />Six of the borough&#39;s primary schools are already providing high quality after school childcare and play services that reflect local needs at no cost to the Council. In the autumn, the Council will provide schools with business support so that this model can be replicated borough-wide from April 2015.  <br /><br />Primary schools will also be given transitional funding so this service remains affordable, ensuring that any fee increases are gradual and in line with the introduction of the new childcare benefit.  From September 2015 working families will be able to access the new tax-free childcare scheme allowing them to recover 20 per cent of their childcare costs.  Families on low incomes will continue to be supported. <br /><br />Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet Member for Family and Children&#39;s Service, said:<br /><br />&#34;We know how vital it is that our parents can access affordable, high quality after school childcare and primary schools in Kensington and Chelsea are already successfully delivering this service.<br /><br />&#34;Faced with large reductions in Government funding we can no longer afford to subsidise childcare for  working parents, especially when most will be receiving the new childcare benefit next year.<br /><br />&#34;We firmly believe that primary schools and social enterprises have the expertise needed to build upon our existing play service so that it remains one of the best in the Capital.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Play services  ","Government funding  ","childcare ","Play services  ","cllr campbell ","Last night (Thursday 17 July) Cabinet agreed a strategy to protect play services in the Royal Borough and place them on a sustainable financial footing for the future.

As well as Legionella, the building has many other defects.  It is tired and institutional.  Rooms are some 16 per cent smaller than modern standards.  None can be classified as wheelchair compliant.  The furniture layout is relatively fixed, meaning residents have less choice about where things go and what personal items they can bring in and several rooms cannot meet current care standards because it is impossible to provide care from either side of the bed.<br /><br />In addition, the overall layout of narrow winding corridors and units spread across three floors makes supervision much more difficult and contributes to far higher running costs than the norm.  A place at Thamesbrook costs approximately twice as much as a place in a private nursing home offering objectively higher standards of accommodation**. <br /><br />During last night&#39;s debate, the Cabinet heard that to simply reopen Thamesbrook on an `as was&#39; basis would require extensive repair and plant modernisation necessitating many months of further closure.  And the cost of that would be considerable at a time when the traditional old people&#39;s home looks increasingly outdated. <br /><br />Rather than the one size fits all service offered by Thamesbrook, local authorities are these days trying to deliver care tailored or `personalised&#39; to individual need.   The review will consider four options including refurbishing the home, remodelling it, replacing it with extra care units either on the site or elsewhere.<br /><br />In extra care housing schemes older people rent, lease or buy their own homes in developments where care is available on site in the quantity and type needed, and which can &#34;scale up&#34; as people become older and frailer.  The evidence is that the extra care approach produces more years of good health and independence but there is a severe shortage of this kind of accommodation in the Royal Borough ***. <br /><br />Commenting on the Cabinet decision to order a fundamental review, Cllr Mary Weale, Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care, said:<br /> <br />&#34;The building simply does not meet the standards we want for our older people.  It is also very expensive to run in its current configuration.  It was a difficult decision to move residents but having been convinced of the advisability and done so, we should now pause and reflect on the future of Thamesbrook to make sure that we provide the best possible facilities for elderly residents.<br /><br />&#34;Before we take any decision about its future, we intend to consult.&#34;","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","cllr Weale","Thamesbrook","older people","care homes","Extra care","The Royal Borough&#39;s Cabinet last night (Thursday 17 July) gave officers the go-ahead to review options for Thamesbrook, a nursing and care home for older people in Chelsea.

The granting of each of these permissions was subject to a condition that disturbance to residents by construction traffic would be minimised through adherence to a Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP). <br /> <br />Following complaints received by the Council about traffic associated with the developments, planners made a series of visits to the two streets during which time construction works at all three properties were found to be in breach of the requirements of the respective CTMPs. Consequently, the Council&#39;s Planning Enforcement Team issued Breach of Condition Notices on the property owners and the development companies Alonso Builders, Capitol Construction and M J Rooney. Furthermore, a Temporary Stop Notice was served on Capitol Construction at 19 Clareville Grove due the repeated nature of the offence.

And while there was strong support for a station at the Chelsea Fire Station site on Dovehouse Street, opinion was divided almost equally between those who felt this was the best location and those who thought it might be better placed further west.  <br /><br />The Council itself supports the Chelsea Fire Station option because it believes this site offers the best combination of public transport and economic benefits.<br /><br /><br />Crossrail 2 would relieve pressure on major London stations such as Euston, Victoria and Clapham Junction and ease congestion on very busy Tube lines. In some cases, journey times could be more than halved.<br /><br />The line would pass deep under Chelsea and a station on the King&#39;s Road would, among other things, link residents to Clapham Junction, the West End and four of London&#39;s busiest mainline stations.<br /><br />The idea for Crossrail 2, formerly called the Chelsea-Hackney Line, has been around for many decades, with the Chelsea Fire Station having long been earmarked as a potential site for the station.<br /><br />Parts of Chelsea remain poorly served by public transport and the Council believes the line would:<br /><br /> dramatically improve local transport options<br /><br /> relieve local and city-wide congestion<br /><br /> ease pressure on the transport network<br /><br /> improve air quality<br /><br /> dramatically improve journey times<br /><br /> help the hard-pressed retail sector<br /><br /><br />Residents can also participate online at http://www.crossrail2.co.uk<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Crossrail 2 ",,,,,"Residents and businesses have just two days left to respond to TfL&#39;s consultation on the route for Crossrail 2 and the Council is urging residents to help make sure the line stops in Chelsea.","Two days left to respond to TfL&#39;s Crossrail 2 station consultation"

As a result, Kensington and Chelsea has decided to step in and meet the cost itself which is estimated to be £435,000 in 2015/16.<br /><br />In 2013/14 Royal Borough emergency grants helped hundreds of people on benefits to move from B&#38;Bs into unfurnished homes, flee domestic violence, repair or replace broken down cookers and fridges or simply keep body and soul together following crime, flood or other misfortune.<br /><br />Councillor Warwick Lightfoot, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&#39;s Cabinet Member for Finance and Strategy, said: &#34;It is plain  that the public finances remain a serious constraint and that the government and local authorities are having to take very difficult decisions to ensure that they are sustainable in the future.<br /><br />&#34;But no one should believe it is easy for local government to absorb this cut.  Our decision to use the Council&#39;s money to replace central government funding means that we have to make further progress in increasing our efficiency,  getting better value for the money we spend and more efficient use of the property assets that we own. It is increased efficiency and economy that enables the Council to continue to help vulnerable people in practical ways.&#34;<br /><br />In addition to paying emergency support grants Kensington and Chelsea is also intending to again bridge the gap between the government grant to pay council tax benefit and the full cost.  The government grant covers only 90 per cent of the cost of the benefit but rather than ask its poorest residents to find the remainder the Council will for a third year pay the difference at a cost of £1million. <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Cllr lightfoot ",,,,,"Emergency financial support for people in crisis will be protected in Kensington and Chelsea next year despite the cancellation of the government grant which funds it.","Council steps in to fund emergency help"

Candles have been generously sponsored by JH Kenyon Funeral Directors and any donations collected at the war memorial will go to the Royal British Legion.<br /><br />During the day the church will be open as usual for people to come in for quiet contemplation and prayer. In addition, at each hour, passages from the Great War poets and scripture will be read aloud. The first reading will be read at 11am by Councillor Maighread Condon-Simmonds, Mayor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, who will also lay a wreath at the memorial to the postal workers who died between 1914-18. In addition, a bell will be tolled for each of the 177 men from St Mary Abbots who died during the first war.<br /><br />Speaking about the event the Mayor said: &#34;The sheer scale of death and injury during the First World War is almost unimaginable.  Services like this one at St Mary Abbots help us to remember the effect it had on local people&#39;s lives.  It brings home the sacrifice made for us by a previous generation of Kensington residents.&#34;<br /><br />There will be an opportunity for members of the public to write their own prayers, and display them on a prayer wall. These prayers will be read at the services of Morning and Evening Prayer, and Holy Communion during the rest of the week. At 1.05pm, there will be a very simple service of Holy Communion, with a particular focus on the beginning of the war (and the breaking of the peace), to which all are welcome.<br /><br />At 10pm, the day culminates with a vigil, lasting about an hour, including some music, readings, and silence. Once again, all are welcome to this service. It will begin in church, and end with a candlelit procession to the war memorial, where the candles will finally be extinguished, in recollection of the words of Sir Edward Grey after war had been declared, &#34;The lamps are going out all over Europe.&#34;<br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Mayor ","Cllr Condon-Simmonds ",,,,"On Monday 4 August the nation will be commemorating the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War, and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea will be marking the occasion with great solemnity.

"6455","21/08/2014","GCSE success for Royal Borough schools","Pupils from Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea schools are celebrating GCSE success after the exam results were announced today (Thursday 21 August). <br />  <br />  This is the first year of results following a switch to a greater emphasis on exams at the end of a two-year course, rather than coursework and modular units and has resulted in the national percentage of students achieving A* to C grades in English falling. <br />  <br />  At Holland Park School 86 per cent of students gained the all important five A* to C grades, including English and mathematics. <br />  <br />  The school is particularly proud of its English Baccalaureate figure which has risen from 43 per cent to 46 per cent this year. This is the proportion of students who have gained the combination of English, mathematics, double science, a language and a humanities subject at GCSE. <br />  <br />  This year, 63 per cent of Holland Park students achieved A* to B, a record for the school, whilst 86 per cent achieved grades A* to C. English results were unaffected by national changes to make the qualification tougher and 94 per cent of students gained A* to C in the subject. <br />  <br />  There were outstanding performances from some of the school&rsquo;s most gifted Year 11 students. Nine such students opened envelopes bringing the news of ten A*s in GCSEs. Olabimpe Popoola is one such student and, after reading her results, she commented: &ldquo;I am absolutely delighted and overwhelmed by my wonderful results. I am now looking forward to returning to Holland Park&rsquo;s sixth form to continue my studies.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Hamish Iyer not only achieved a raft of A*s at GCSE but also an A grade in A2 mathematics a year early. Hamish described his results as &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;My aspiration for a career in medicine appears to be on course thanks to Holland Park.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  These figures make this year the highest recorded GCSE achievement in the school&rsquo;s history. Colin Hall, Head of Holland Park School, said: "I am incredibly proud of our students' achievements. They are a testament to the diligence and strongly collaborative working relationships that exist between students and teachers at Holland Park School." <br />  <br />  It was also an historic day for the Chelsea Academy which received its first set of GCSE results. <br />  <br />  The Academy, which opened in 2009, is the first new state secondary school to open in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in 50 years. 64 per cent of students achieved five A* to C grades including English and mathematics. <br />  <br />  Acting?Principal, Charlotte Harrison said: "We are so proud of our students&rsquo; results and want to congratulate them and the staff who have worked tirelessly towards this milestone. A huge amount of hard work and dedication on the part of students and staff over the past five years has paid off. Congratulations and thank you to all staff and parents who have played a part in this success and supported the students &ndash; this is a very special day in their lives and we wish them all well wherever their next steps take them."?? <br />  <br />  Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School enjoyed another fine year with 93 per cent of pupils achieving five or more GCSEs graded A* to C, including English and mathematics. <br />  <br />  Matthew Bacarese-Hamilton is one pupil who achieved an exceptional run of results, scoring ten A* and two A grades. He said: &ldquo;I feel great. I was really nervous but it&rsquo;s a big relief to have received such good grades. I look forward to beginning my A levels at the Vaughan next term and going on to university after that.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Headmaster, Paul Stubbings said: &ldquo;This is the reward for all the hard work and dedication of pupils and staff alike. The support of our parents also plays a massive role in achieving such outstanding results.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  There was plenty to celebrate at St Thomas More Language College where 67 per cent of pupils gained five or more A* to C, including English and mathematics. <br />  <br />  Dr Trevor Papworth, Head of Thomas More Language College, congratulated the pupils saying: &ldquo;On the back of our outstanding Ofsted and diocese inspections we can now celebrate another set of GCSE results that reflect the hard work of pupils, families and staff. The school is particularly pleased to see yet another increase in its mathematics results.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  At Sion Manning school 50 per cent of pupils gained five or more A* to C grades, including English and mathematics and 56 per cent achieved 5 A* to C. <br />  <br />  Councillor Emma Will, Cabinet Member for Education, said: &ldquo;Congratulations to all of the pupils and staff on such good GCSE results.

It enables residents and community groups to take a lead role in bringing about practical, positive change in their neighbourhoods. The aim of City Living, Local Life is to build on what is already going on in communities, encouraging local people to come forward with their experiences of neighbourhood issues and working with ward councillors to come up with solutions. <br />  <br />  The programme gives small amounts of money and lots of practical support to the best ideas. Each ward that takes part in the initiative has a small budget that can be used to help make projects a reality. For wards with three councillors, this is up to &pound;20,000 per year. For those with two councillors, it is up to &pound;14,000. Each area of Kensington and Chelsea is unique, and so are the approaches taken by different wards and the projects supported. <br />  <br />  Cllr Gerard Hargreaves, Cabinet Member for Voluntary Organisations and Resident Engagement said: &ldquo;I am delighted that Courtfield is now part of City Living, Local Life. I&rsquo;m sure that the local councillors and residents will work closely together to come with plenty of worthwhile projects to enhance and improve their area&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Courtfield councillors will soon be meeting with officers to decide how to kick-start City Living, Local Life activity in their ward.

In June 2014, a Temporary Stop Notice was served to prevent unauthorised work continuing and a second notice was also served which required that the condition and appearance of the property be improved. The owner subsequently applied for planning permission retrospectively for the unauthorised works but the planning permission was refused on Friday 19 September 2014. <br />  <br />  As a result, a Listed Building Enforcement Notice and Enforcement Notice have been served on the property today (Thursday 25 September) requiring the owner to remove the unauthorised works by Saturday 1 November 2014 or face further legal action. <br />  <br />  The property is Grade II listed and the first building both pedestrians and drivers see when entering the Royal Borough from Shepherd's Bush. Its poor condition has attracted many complaints over the years. The property is part of a unified composition which includes the Royal Crescent and numbers 170 to 178 Holland Park Avenue. The set of buildings are inspired by the Royal Crescent&rsquo;s namesake in Bath, Somerset. <br />  <br />  Councillor Timothy Coleridge, the Council's Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: "Taken in their entirety, this set of buildings are a work of art and it is the owner&rsquo;s responsibility to look after and care for their property so future generations can appreciate what has been created.

Also in attendance were the current owners of 51 Abingdon Villas, Ben Wisen and Margaret O&rsquo;Riordan and also local residents David Charlesworth and Charles Mickleworth who researched and proposed the idea of a blue plaque to the ward Councillors. <br />  <br />  Clementine Hozier lived on Abington Villas from 1903 until her marriage to Winston Churchill in 1908. <br />  <br />  As Clementine Churchill she took an active role on the home front in both world wars. During the first she organised canteens for munitions workers on behalf of the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association for which she was awarded a CBE in 1918. <br />  <br />  In World War 2 Lady Churchill was again involved, this time as Chairman of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund, the President of the Young Women's Christian Association War Time Appeal and the Chairman of Fulmer Chase Maternity Hospital for Wives of Junior Officers. <br />  <br />  The Mayor, Cllr Condon-Simmonds&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Lady Clementine Churchill did an huge amount during both world wars, not to mention having to deal with the pressure Sir Winston was under as Prime Minster in such a dark hour. She also worked hard as a cross-bench peer in the House of Lords in later life. I am delighted we are able to recognise her and mark her early life in the Royal Borough.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Sir Nicholas Soames added: &ldquo;On behalf of my whole family can I thank the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for their generosity and kindness in commemorating my grandmother Lady Churchill&rsquo;s early life in the borough.

She would have been very touched to have been remembered in this way.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  The blue plaque is part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s City Living, Local Life initiative.

"6489","02/10/2014","Young people and families express themselves through film","Three short films made by young people and families who have worked closely with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s Families Forward Service were given their premier at a special screening at Kensington Town Hall. <br />  <br />  The films were made after participants, aged between eight and 38 attended a series of courses, run by See Change Films, designed to provide families and young people with creative ways to express themselves and explore the world around them. In learning to create film, photography and music of a high standard, the participants also learned how to collaborate and work as a team. <br />  <br />  Three very different films were screened: <br />  <br />  One tells the story of Richard &ndash; a former gang member, who lived on the Aylesbury Estate. He shares a candid account of what it was like to be part of a gang &ndash; the positive and negative aspects - and how he perceives gangs today. Following the death of his cousin from gang-related violence, Richard transformed his life and is now studying business and marketing at university and training to become a professional boxer. He wants to share the perils of gang life and encourage more young people to speak out about their experiences in gangs. <br />  <br />  Another film, about parkour, explores this sport from the perspective of the practitioners who work at Parkour Generations in London. It explains the philosophy, when the sport was introduced and why people love it. It&rsquo;s a fast-paced film with lots of examples of people using parkour to move from one place to another in London. <br />  <br />  The final film is about food and culture and begins with a number of individuals from different cultures and ethnic backgrounds in Notting Hill sharing their favourite cuisine. The story centres on Adam, the owner of Maramia, the only Palestinian restaurant in the UK. Adam gives his perspective on living among many different cultures and how this is different from his experience of growing up in Palestine. He also shares details of his love of food and how his mother, who works with him in the restaurant, is the person who taught him everything he knows. <br />  <br />  It was not just the moving image that was celebrated. Photographers produced a multi-media piece which focuses on the young people from groups who went on a trip to Wales, organised by Mountain Wise. The group reflects on where they are from and how this trip to the countryside provided them with the chance to overcome mental and physical challenges. <br />  <br />  The filmmakers, composers and photographers were presented with certificates to mark their achievements by the Leader of the Council, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown. <br />  <br />  Commenting on the evening, Cllr Paget-Brown, said: &ldquo;I was very impressed by the quality and content of what were three very different films. I&rsquo;d like to congratulate all those who worked so hard to make them and thank the Council officers and See Change Films who supported them.&rdquo; <br />  Al-Kabir Basem, a graduate filmmaker, said: &ldquo;Oh my god this evening is impressive &ndash; it&rsquo;s very, very joyful for me and I can see what I did and I&rsquo;m very glad that I can see what we did. <br />  &ldquo;Basically I&rsquo;ve learned a lot not just one thing, I&rsquo;ve learned communication skills, filming skills, interviewing skills, a lot of things.

A search for his successor is already underway. <br />  <br />  Jonathan has worked in different branches of planning for 37 years. Before coming to the Royal Borough he spent 15 years in the Planning Inspectorate making decisions on major developments and planning appeals, and five years with urban designers and master planners Urban Initiatives. Jonathan joined the Council as its Executive Director for Planning and Borough Development at the beginning of 2010; a time when the Royal Borough was already renowned for having some of the most intense development pressures to be found anywhere in the world. <br />  <br />  It has been his job to help balance those development pressures against the need to conserve the traditional character of Kensington and Chelsea and the quality of life of its residents. His many contributions to that task include: <br />  &bull; Gaining an exemption for the entire borough from a measure that would have permitted the conversion of offices to homes without planning permission, thus risking a loss of enterprises based in the borough offering local employment <br />  &bull; Reducing turnaround times for planning registration, planning applications and land charge searches and making the major application service the fastest in London <br />  &bull; Getting rid of a backlog of more than 600 overdue planning applications whilst dealing with a 60 per cent increase in workload <br />  &bull; Developing fully electronic working in the Planning Department <br />  &bull; Leading London&rsquo;s fightback against mega-basements and super-prime flats through the development of tough new policies that include reducing the size of basements to 50 per cent of the garden&rsquo;s length and just one storey (instead of 85 per cent of the garden and unlimited depth) <br />  &bull; Launching the new and highly popular pre-application advice service which helps to support the Department&rsquo;s resources <br />  &bull; Expanding the Development Management and Conservation and Design teams <br />  &bull; Creating the Neighbourhood Planning Team <br />  &bull; Creating a dynamic new Planning Enforcement team that takes on developers and contractors who ignore the rules <br />  &bull; Bringing in the policy that stopped pubs from being converted to houses <br />  &bull; Starting the programme of new appraisals for the borough&rsquo;s conservation areas <br />  &bull; Overseeing the work leading to the production of the SPD and then the planning permission for the Earl&rsquo;s Court development <br />  <br />  When there was last a vacancy for this role, it took time to find a candidate with the right skills. Jonathan has kindly agreed to continue in post through 2015, working fewer days but flexibly to complete important tasks such as bringing in the tougher policy on basement developments; strengthening planning enforcement; maintaining the high standards of service achieved under his leadership; and offering a handover period for a successor. This minimises the risk of a temporary gap if the first search for a new Executive Director comes up short. <br />  <br />  Commenting on Jonathan&rsquo;s decision to retire, Cllr Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: &ldquo;With many planning decisions in Kensington and Chelsea, there is a very great deal at stake, both financially and in terms of quality of life. That means that our planning decisions are often fiercely contested, even bitterly so. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;Jonathan Bore has never wilted under that intense pressure. He has been tough, fearless in the face of powerful developers armed with expensive lawyers, and at all times fair. In his time with us, he has done a great deal to conserve the best of this borough for its current residents and to plan improvements for the benefits of its future residents.

The move follows residents&rsquo; concerns that construction vehicles were causing disruption along Campden Hill and Campden Hill Road. <br />  <br />  Developers of the site, formerly part of Holland Park School, are currently implementing a planning permission for the creation of 72 new residential units. This was granted subject to a condition that disturbance to residents would be minimised through adherence to a CTMP. <br />  <br />  Following complaints to the Council about traffic associated with the development, planners made a series of visits to the site and found construction vehicles to be in breach of the requirements of the CTMP. <br />  <br />  Consequently, the Council's Planning Enforcement Team issued a Breach of Condition Notice and a Temporary Stop Notice on both the owner of the site, GC Campden Hill LLP, and on the site contractor, McGee Group Limited, on Monday 20 October 2014. The effect of these notices means any future breaches of the CTMP will be a criminal offence. Each breach witnessed could lead to a maximum fine of &pound;20,000 in a magistrates&rsquo; court and unlimited if heard in a crown court. <br />  <br />  Councillor Timothy Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: &ldquo;The Council is continuing with its efforts to tackle developers who blatantly disregard their planning conditions and cause our residents disruption in the process. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;We will use all the powers available to us, regardless of the size of the development or the contractor involved.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Construction traffic in residential areas can have a big impact on the lives of neighbouring residents if developers ignore their planning conditions.

Amongst other things, the scheme would deliver: <br />  <br />  &bull; new affordable housing <br />  &bull; new private housing for sale <br />  &bull; a new environmentally friendly depot that is less noisy and smelly <br />  &bull; energy efficient buildings, and <br />  &bull; much improved streetscape. <br />  <br />  As well as authorising the appointment of a development team to draw up a scheme to be considered by residents and the Cabinet, a set of safeguards was agreed to protect the interests of the tenants and leaseholders who live above the depot and car park. <br />  <br />  If the scheme is approved, all Secure Tenants will be rehoused by the Council, ideally in a brand new home on the redeveloped estate, or elsewhere in the borough if they prefer. <br />  They will be entitled to a Home Loss Payment of &pound;4,900 plus a Disturbance Payment to cover the reasonable costs of moving home. All resident leaseholders will have their property purchased at the full market value. <br />  <br />  They will also be entitled to an additional ten per cent of the market value up to a maximum of &pound;49,000 and a Disturbance Payment to cover the reasonable costs of moving. In addition the Cabinet agreed the Council will develop an offer of an equity share for all resident leaseholders to enable them to purchase and live in one of the new properties on the site. This means the existing mixed community of Council tenants and resident leaseholders will be protected and able to continue living on that site, if they so choose. <br />  <br />  Non-resident leaseholders will have their property purchased at the full market value with the owners entitled to a basic loss payment of 7.5 per cent of the value up to a maximum of &pound;75,000 plus the reasonable costs of acquiring a new investment property. Non-resident leaseholders will be entitled to apply to become resident leaseholders if they wish to obtain the same compensation as resident leaseholders. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;Pembroke Road costs a great deal to run and we simply don&rsquo;t need to continue using much of the depot or offices anymore,&rdquo; said the Deputy Leader of the Council, Councillor Rock Feilding-Mellen. &ldquo;What we do need is new affordable homes and new income to help protect our front line services. If at the same time we can dramatically improve the streetscape and local environment of this corner of the borough that would be a tremendous bonus. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t be taking this development forward unless we can be sure we are being fair to our existing tenants and leaseholders,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We have put together a cast-iron compensation package which responds to the concerns and worries residents have expressed over the last 18 months. We will make sure to protect the strong mixed-community that currently lives there.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  There will be extensive consultation with residents and if the development plans go ahead, up to 116 new affordable homes could be provided on the site, double what is currently there. There could also be up to 176 new private homes for sale and rent. In addition, there may be office space and new retail units at ground floor level. The existing nursery will be retained and as part of the design process, the viability of a new school building will be explored. <br />  <br />  The appointment process for an architect-led development team will get underway in the New Year.&nbsp;<br />  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","The Cabinet of the Royal Borough last night agreed (Thursday 30 October 2014) to consider the redevelopment of two 1960s Council buildings in Kensington, with the potential to provide nearly 300 new homes. <br />","New future for major Council facility in Kensington"

The proposals could see a brand new school expanded to two forms of entry to help meet demand for primary school places. <br />  <br />  At the same time, a new school for children with special educational needs could be built on the Barlby site. The profile of special educational needs in Kensington and Chelsea has changed dramatically in recent years. Most notably, the number of children with autistic spectrum disorder has more than quadrupled, from 28 in 2003 to 121 in 2013. <br />  <br />  Adjoining Barlby Primary School is the Treverton Estate (adjacent to the Balfour of Burleigh Estate), parts of which are in need of investment. The Council believes there may be the opportunity to improve existing homes, provide additional new affordable homes and also deliver significant public realm improvements. <br />  <br />  The Council will now commission a design team to come up with potential design options for the new schools and a masterplan for the wider area. The Council aims to consult on these options early in 2015.

More than 1,000 schools across the capital have already signed up to the scheme; so far 447 schools have achieved bronze award, 54 silver and two gold. <br />  <br />  Healthy Schools London encourages schools to teach their pupils about the importance of healthy eating, regular physical activity, emotional health and general wellbeing. <br />  <br />  Thomas Jones has succeeded in promoting a healthy lifestyle to all pupils at the school, teaching them about growing fresh produce, making healthy food choices and good oral health.

But the truth is, you can&rsquo;t tell a restaurant&rsquo;s hygiene standards by how clean and tidy the staff look or by how busy it is. <br />  <br />  It&rsquo;s the things you can&rsquo;t see &ndash; like germs spread by bad hygiene practices - that you need to consider. There&rsquo;s one easy way to set your mind at rest &ndash; check the food hygiene rating. <br />  <br />  The food hygiene rating tells you about hygiene standards in restaurants and other food businesses. It&rsquo;s really easy to check. Just go online and check the Food Standards Agency website: www.food.gov.uk/ratings or if you&rsquo;re out and about look for the green and black sticker; if you can&rsquo;t see one, just ask. <br />  <br />  The ratings are determined by local authority food safety officers and run from 0 to 5, with a 5 rating meaning a very good level of food hygiene. Ninety three per cent of food businesses are rated 3 or better so there are plenty of places with good standards and you can easily making a bad choice. <br />  <br />  Catherine Brown, Chief Executive for the Food Standards Agency, agrees: &ldquo;This Christmas, do this one little thing for peace of mind when eating out.Take a moment to check the food hygiene rating, pick the right place and enjoy a great meal out.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Councillor Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for people in Kensington and Chelsea to check hygiene ratings online and choose a restaurant for their Christmas parties that takes food hygiene seriously.

"6538","13/11/2014","Food businesses need to prepare for changes to food allergen information","Food businesses in Kensington and Chelsea need to be ready for new rules which, from December, will affect the way they provide allergen information. <br />  <br />  Currently, when, for example, supermarket bakeries, delis, caf&eacute;s and restaurants sell loose foods, they don&rsquo;t have to provide information to customers about food allergens, but from 13 December 2014 all food businesses will need to explain or provide allergenic information for the food they sell or provide. <br />  <br />  Food allergies can cause life-threatening reactions and the numbers of people with this condition are growing. <br />  <br />  The primary cause of food allergy deaths in the UK is due to reactions when food is consumed outside the home where allergenic ingredients have not been declared. The new rules will mean that all food businesses will need to inform customers if any of 14 allergenic ingredients are present in the food they make or serve. This can be communicated to customers in writing on menus, verbally through explanations by staff or by pointing out where or how more information can be found. <br />  <br />  Although the new EU rules are coming into force in December 2014, they were published in October 2011, to give food businesses three years to get ready for the new provisions. <br />  <br />  Cllr Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &ldquo;All food businesses in Kensington and Chelsea should be ready to provide this vital information by December. We understand food businesses work long hours, leaving little time to read through new guidance. However, easy-to-understand information is available on the Food Standards Agency website at www.food.gov.uk to help businesses with these changes. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;Businesses could be missing out on vital custom by not providing clear and accurate allergen information about the food they sell or serve. If any business needs advice and guidance on the new rules, they can get in touch with a Council food safety officer for help.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Dr Chun-Han Chan from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said: &ldquo;Food allergies affect approximately five to eight per cent of children and one to two per cent of adults. This means that around two million people in the UK are living with a food allergy. People with food allergies can react to very small amounts of food, such as a teaspoon of yoghurt, a single peanut or even egg glaze used to brush over pies. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;There is no cure for food allergies, so the only way for people to manage the condition is to avoid the food that makes them ill. This is where providing accurate food allergen labelling and information is important, and why food businesses, local authorities and the FSA are all working together to ensure consumers have clear and accurate information.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Local authorities will be working together with the FSA to make sure businesses know what to do and how to provide safe food for those with food allergies and intolerances. To help enforcement officers and businesses with these new rules, the FSA has developed a range of training and education materials.

It presents rarely seen masterpieces of Victorian art belonging to the Mexican collector Juan Antonio P&eacute;rez Sim&oacute;n. Until the 29 March 2015 visitors to Leighton House Museum can experience 52 exceptional paintings from the largest Victorian private art collection outside Great Britain, shown for the first time in the UK - alongside six works by Frederic, Lord Leighton, four of which will be returning to the house in which they were painted.</p>  <p>The images range from the domestic to the romantic and from the symbolic to the overtly sensual.&nbsp; The exhibition&rsquo;s highlights include Alma-Tadema&rsquo;s magnificent The Roses of Heliogabalus (1888), an iconic image of Roman decadence which has not been exhibited in London since 1913.&nbsp; One of the great paintings of the Victorian era, it memorably depicts the Emperor Heliogabalus&rsquo;s suffocation of his guests beneath a torrent of rose petals.&nbsp; Leighton&rsquo;s Greek Girls Picking up Pebbles by the Sea (1871) is one of his earliest and most striking aesthetic works, placing formal harmony above narrative content and showing Leighton as the master of English drapery.&nbsp; Two further works, Antigone (1882) and the sexually charged Crenaia, the Nymph of the Dargle (1880), feature the model Dorothy Dene. Leighton&rsquo;s relationship with Dene was significant in his later years, when her role as his principal model, muse and social companion was widely commented on. </p>  <p>Outstanding pictures by Albert Moore, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, John William Waterhouse, Edward Poynter, John Strudwick and John William Godward are also displayed in the intimate and splendid environment of Leighton House.&nbsp; As President of the Royal Academy, Leighton and his extraordinary studio-house were at the centre of the late Victorian art world. His annual concerts and receptions became fixtures of the artistic social calendar. These artists knew the house well and Leighton&rsquo;s own collection contained pictures by several of them, including a nude study by Albert Moore that returns to Leighton House for the first time since 1896 as part of the exhibition.</p>  <p>The exhibition has been shown at the Jacquemart-Andr&eacute; Museum in Paris, the Chiostro del Bramante in Rome and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid to great acclaim. The exhibition has been curated by Daniel Robbins, Senior Curator at Leighton House Museum and V&eacute;ronique Gerard Powell who has worked extensively on the P&eacute;rez Sim&oacute;n Collection.&nbsp; With the exception of Leighton&rsquo;s painting studio, the permanent collection has been cleared from Leighton House and the exhibition hung throughout the historic interiors.&nbsp; Leighton&rsquo;s extraordinary decorative schemes provide a uniquely appropriate and authentic setting for the pictures belonging to Juan Antonio P&eacute;rez Sim&oacute;n, making the exhibition an unmissable event and an unforgettable one-off aesthetic experience. </p>  <p>On his collection being displayed at Leighton House, Juan Antonio P&eacute;rez Sim&oacute;n commented &ldquo;It is an honour to be a part of the journey that allows these masterpieces to be shown in such an authentic setting, and in some cases returning to their home. It gives me great joy to know that the public will be able to appreciate these exceptional paintings, making us accomplices in our everlasting duty to nourish the spirit.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Councillor Timothy Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, Transport and Arts, commented: &ldquo;It is a great honour for us to be hosting the only UK exhibition of this prestigious collection at Leighton House Museum.&nbsp; There could be no more fitting venue than Leighton&rsquo;s studio-house where some of the works were actually painted and which was familiar to so many of the artists who are represented in the exhibition.&nbsp; We look forward to welcoming many new visitors to discover the museum and collection for the first time and enjoy a unique aesthetic experience.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Senior Curator for Leighton House Museum, Daniel Robbins said &lsquo;It has been a wonderful opportunity to work so closely with this fantastic collection of pictures. The House is now transformed by the paintings and the paintings enhanced by setting them within Leighton&rsquo;s decorative interiors; there has never been an exhibition where so many outstanding pictures of this period has been shown in such a special and sympathetic environment. It&rsquo;s a unique setting and a special moment for the public to see these works, some of which are returning home to the very place they were painted.<br />  <br />  For more information go to <a href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/museums">www.rbkc.gov.uk/museums</a> </p>","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","<p>A Victorian Obsession: The P&eacute;rez Sim&oacute;n Collection opened at Leighton House Museum on Friday 14 November.

It resulted in more than 60 criminal investigations, with 27 arrests, the recovery of over &pound;100,000 and traffickers receiving sentences totalling over 35 years. <br />  <br />  On Monday 8 December the ECAT Project Tool-kit will be launched at the final ECAT Conference at City Hall, London SE1. It will showcase the findings from the two year project. Kevin Hyland, the UK&rsquo;s first ever Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner will be speaking, he was appointed by the Home Secretary on 13 November 2014. <br />  <br />  Commenting on the work, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s Cabinet Member for Community Safety, IT and Corporate Services, Councillor Joanna Gardner, said: &ldquo;The scourge of human trafficking is something we must do all we can to stop, as it is going on in our community and takes many forms from slavery to prostitution. The collaborative work across the ECAT project that has been carried out across organisations and countries has had some significant successes. I hope that the launch of the toolkit to help tackle human trafficking and the findings over the two years of this project will help others, throughout Europe, to build on its great work and combat human trafficking.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  For more information on the ECAT Project go to www.rbkc.gov.uk/againsthumantrafficking <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","A two-year collaboration between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Metropolitan Police to tackle human trafficking is coming to an end next month (December). <br />","Anti-trafficking pilot comes to an end"

Planning permission was granted subject to a condition that construction traffic would not deliver to and from the site before 9.30am or after 3pm. This was to ensure construction traffic did not lead to traffic congestion when schoolchildren and parents were travelling to the two nearby schools. </p>  <p>Following reports to the Council its planning enforcement officers witnessed construction traffic serving each site before 9.30am. Consequently, the officers issued Breach of Condition Notices on the property owners and the development companies Primus Build Ltd and Intelitrade Developments Ltd on the 25 November 2014. Despite this, early morning deliveries continued at 38 Victoria Road and therefore a Temporary Stop Notice was served on Intelitrade Development Ltd on the 5 December 2014 due to the repeated nature of the offence and the immediate harm it was causing. The effect of these notices means any future breaches by the developers will be a criminal offence. Each breach witnessed could lead to a maximum penalty of &pound;20,000 in a magistrates court and unlimited if heard in a crown court.</p>  <p>Cllr Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: "The Council takes a strict line with developers who ignore their planning conditions which we impose to protect residents from the unreasonable impact of construction traffic. This is particularly the case when development is in close proximity to schools and therefore both developers must comply with their planning conditions or face the prospect of being prosecuted." </p>  <p>Temporary stop notices are used sparingly by most local authorities.

However, during the valuation process concerns were raised that Dr Babiker and his family were not using the property as their main and principal home. These concerns were relayed to the Council&rsquo;s Fraud Investigation Team which then carried out a thorough investigation which established that Dr Babiker had in fact sublet the flat to another family while he and his family were living in North Wales. <br />  <br />  At the original hearing on 11 November His Honour Judge Dugdale commented that council homes were a limited resource let at a reduced rate. <br />  <br />  During the sentencing hearing on 15 December Dr Babiker said he was trying to help the sub-tenant, who needed somewhere to live.

It&rsquo;s the little things you do that can make a real difference. So if you make sure that your turkey is defrosted safely and in good time, you can enjoy your meal happily and safely.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Councillor Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &ldquo;Take the time to make sure your Christmas lunch is not spoiled by nasty bacteria.

Cold temperature slows the growth of germs on food and will keep it safe and fresh. <br />  &bull; Cover the turkey whilst defrosting - leave in the packaging or put it in a container to hold any thawing juices, and place it at the bottom of the fridge to avoid cross-contamination. <br />  &bull; Defrost thoroughly - as otherwise your turkey may not cook evenly and harmful bacteria could survive the cooking process. <br />  &bull; Raw turkey - should always be put in the bottom of the fridge until ready to use.

He later moved into three dimensional public artworks and digital installations, ranging from a 5m tall Tree of Life which generates power from the wind, to interactive projection systems engaging thousands of people and linking two towns. More information is available at www.arte-ofchange.com <br />  <br />  Heart of the Community marks Peter&rsquo;s return to the medium of the photomural. <br />  <br />  Peter said of the work: &ldquo;I focused on the extraordinary acts of ordinary people who rose above the challenges life dealt them to create something of value for us all. A lot of history happened behind this wall, starting with Portobello Farm which gave the road its name. So I decided to open up the wall, showing different events in a time-space continuum. I&rsquo;ve also had fun playing with the tradition of History Painting: the epic sweep and exaggerated perspective. I&rsquo;ve incorporated the styles, and in some cases the work of artists of a particular period. There are some visual jokes too &ndash; enjoy.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Councillor Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for the Arts, said at the unveiling: &ldquo;The Council is proud to support this new installation which brings the Portobello Road North Wall to life and celebrates the area&rsquo;s residents, history and events.

The title for the installation, One Five Zero, is in recognition of the fact that 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of market trading in North Kensington.

Documentation received during the police investigation showed Belaidi was in fact Mr Hassan Samrani, a Moroccan national. <br />  <br />  Subsequently, Council investigators obtained witness statements and documentation from the Metropolitan Police and Mr Samrani was interviewed under caution on 27 November 2013, with officers from Wandsworth Council present. During the interview he accepted his real name was Hassan Samrani. <br />  <br />  Following an investigation Samrani was summonsed by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in respect of the offences on behalf of both boroughs <br />  <br />  On the 24 October 2014 Mr Samrani, who had pleaded not guilty at a previous hearing, changed his plea to guilty on all counts at Isleworth Crown Court. <br />  <br />  In sentencing Samrani on Monday 5 January 2015 at Isleworth Crown Court His Honour Judge Denniss stated that the offences had taken considerable planning including paying for a false ID, passport and driving licence. <br />  <br />  The court heard in mitigation that Mr Samrani had sought to regularise his immigration status and now has four children with his wife and also stepchildren. <br />  <br />  In summing up Judge Denniss indicated that his starting point for sentencing was 24-months in custody. However, he gave Samrani limited credit for changing his plea to guilty and sentenced him to 18-months imprisonment to run concurrently on all counts. <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","A man with two identities who falsely claimed more than &pound;61,000 in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Borough of Wandsworth was sentenced yesterday (Monday 5 January) at Isleworth Crown Court to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to eight counts of fraud and two counts of using false identity documents. <br />","Benefit claimant with false identity sentenced to 18 months in prison"

The Council&rsquo;s annual performance report shows a 21.6 per cent reduction, a saving of over 5,000 tonnes of carbon since 2008. This has resulted in financial savings to the Council and its contractors of more than &pound;2m since 2008. <br />  <br />  The next milestone will be in 2017 by which time carbon emissions are planned to be down 30 per cent from 2008 levels. <br />  <br />  Welcoming the reduction Cllr Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environment, said: &ldquo;This is good news, not only for the environment, but for residents.

"6584","09/01/2015","Council steps in to protect landmark pub","Royal Borough planners have stepped in to protect the Kensington Park Hotel public house on Ladbroke Grove from a change of use. <br />  <br />  According to local campaigners the historic &ldquo;KPH&rdquo; is threatened with closure and conversion, either to a mix of commercial and residential uses or to luxury flats. <br />  <br />  The Council already has in place planning policies to resist the loss of pubs and those uses which contribute to the character of a conservation area. But it has now also imposed an immediate Article 4 Direction which will protect the pub&rsquo;s status for the next six months and means that a planning application will be required if it is proposed to change to another use. <br />  <br />  Essentially the direction removes the owners&rsquo; right to an automatic switch to another &ldquo;A Class&rdquo; use, such as a shop, financial or professional service, restaurant or caf&eacute;, or for a temporary office. Such a move would now require planning permission and any such application would be determined solely on its merits. <br />  <br />  Cllr Tim Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: &ldquo;Pubs are important community assets and few more so than the KPH. It has a rich and colourful history, and is as vibrant today as it ever was. The Article 4 Direction means that there can&rsquo;t be change until the local community and the community for whom the KPH is the local have had their say.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  The Direction must be confirmed by the Council, but before this happens any representations must be taken into account.

In fact, listed buildings are such an important part of our heritage that it is a crime to carry out works on one without first getting consent from the Council. If unapproved works take place both the owner and the builder will be liable and can be fined up to &pound;20,000 for a single offence. <br />  <br />  In an attempt to remind, and in some cases inform, owners and householders that their building is listed, planners from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea are writing to all the borough&rsquo;s listed homes this year. <br />  <br />  There are about 3,800 listed buildings in the Royal Borough as part of a list drawn up and managed by the government acting on advice from English Heritage. <br />  <br />  When a property has listed status this means: <br />  <br />  The whole of the building is protected and specifically includes the inside as well as the outside and all architectural features and structures within the grounds. <br />  <br />  A listed building may not be demolished or altered in any way unless listed building consent has been obtained from the Royal Borough. <br />  <br />  That consent may be required for works of repair, cleaning or painting (or repainting of the interior or exterior). <br />  <br />  All grades of listed buildings are equally protected. <br />  <br />  This does not necessarily mean that a listed building has to be preserved exactly as it is now, but alterations and extensions must be carried out in a manner that respects the building&rsquo;s historical and architectural importance. <br />  <br />  Councillor Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: &ldquo;Listed buildings come in all shapes and sizes ranging from the iconic Trellick Tower to a Holland Park Mews house. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;One thing they do have in common though is the responsibility for the owner to ensure they are properly looked after. This means there are tight rules governing what can and cannot be done inside and outside the building which often catches our residents out. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;To help, our planning enforcement team is embarking on a publicity campaign to help owners and householders avoid theses pitfalls, thereby preventing delays and unnecessary costs to residents.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Owners who are unsure whether consent is required for any works are advised to seek advice from the Council&rsquo;s planning officers before any work is started.

"6598","27/01/2015","Advice from London Ambulance Service ahead of strike on Thursday 29 January","London Ambulance Service is advising Londoners to plan ahead and expect long delays during a 24-hour NHS strike on Thursday (29 January). If the strike goes ahead it will be longer than on previous occasions and so will be much more disruptive. <br />  <br />  The Service is issuing advice to people on regular medication, those who have long- term illnesses and older people for the period of industrial action which starts at 00.01am on Thursday. It is asking friends and family of vulnerable people to make arrangements to support their relative, friend or neighbour. Either to take them to hospital or use other healthcare options such as Urgent Care Centres, pharmacies, their GP and NHS 111. <br />  <br />  The Service is expecting to be under considerable pressure during the strike and the disruption will continue on Friday (30 January) as the Service works hard to return to normal operating. <br />  <br />  Chief Executive Dr Fionna Moore said: &ldquo;We will only be able to send an ambulance response to the most seriously ill and injured patients. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re advising: <br />  <br />  &bull; If you are feeling unwell before Thursday 29 January do not to wait to get help, but to seek advice from your GP or pharmacist beforehand. <br />  <br />  &bull; If you have a long-term or chronic condition and you are feeling unwell on Thursday 29 January, try not to be alone if you think you may need support to either get to hospital or to access other healthcare options. <br />  <br />  &bull; If you have regular medication &ndash; please make sure you have collected your prescription from the GP, have been to the pharmacist to collect it and have it to hand. <br />  <br />  &bull; If you are under the care of a community health team, make sure that you have their contact numbers to hand. <br />  <br />  &bull; If you are in the late stages of pregnancy please check any arrangements you have made with friends or family to ensure that they can take you to hospital should you go into labour this Thursday, as we will not be able to send an ambulance.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Dr Moore added: &ldquo;Those looking after vulnerable groups &ndash; such as older people, children and people with long-term conditions &ndash; should be prepared to make alternative arrangements to get medical help or transport those in their care to hospital.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  This third period of industrial action is more significant than previous strikes because it is for 24-hours rather than four. This means that, as well as lengthy delays, some people will not get an ambulance response if they are not in an immediately life-threatening condition. <br />  <br />  Dr Moore said: &ldquo;We will be unable to send an ambulance response to some patients with broken bones, some older people who may have fallen and cannot get up and some people in road traffic collisions where their life is not immediately at risk. We&rsquo;d encourage Londoners to plan ahead, be sensible about their activities and be prepared should they need medical help on Thursday.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Londoners are advised to contact other healthcare providers instead of calling 999 &ndash; such as visiting their pharmacist, Urgent Care Centre or GP, calling NHS 111 or making their own way to an emergency department if they need urgent treatment. <br />  <br />  Follow the London Ambulance Service on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ldn_ambulance or visit Facebook athttps://www.facebook.com/pages/London-Ambulance-Service-NHS-Trust/1429957480579429&nbsp;<br />  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","London Ambulance Service is advising Londoners to plan ahead and expect long delays during a 24-hour NHS strike on Thursday (29 January).

Local paediatricians and GPs are increasingly finding cases of rickets and other severe manifestations of vitamin D deficiency. <br />  <br />  The Healthy Start vitamins for women include the essential daily vitamins D, C and folic acid while the children&rsquo;s vitamins include D, C and A. <br />  <br />  To help promote the uptake of these vitamins, Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust, which provides health visiting services in the borough, is running a campaign &lsquo;Vitamin D for Me&rsquo; throughout February. <br />  <br />  Vitamin D deficiency is thought to be much more common than most people realise. A 2007 survey estimated that around 50 per cent of all adults have some degree of vitamin D deficiency and 16 per cent have a severe deficiency during winter and spring. This is because the main source of vitamin D is sunlight. A very small amount is available through foods such as eggs, oily fish and dairy products but it is difficult to get enough through food alone. Consequently, the Department of Health recommend that all pregnant and breastfeeding women should take a daily vitamin D supplement. It is also especially important for children under five to grow healthy bones and teeth. <br />  <br />  Cllr Mary Weale, Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care and Public Health, said: &ldquo;Vitamin D is an essential, daily vitamin that is difficult to obtain from food alone. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;The good news is that a supplement needn&rsquo;t cost anything and I would encourage all mothers, pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy to go to their nearest health centre or children&rsquo;s centre and pick up some Healthy Start vitamins.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Pregnant women, new mothers and children in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea are being encouraged to protect themselves against vitamin D deficiency this winter by taking free Healthy Start vitamins, available from their nearest children&rsquo;s centre or health centre. <br />","Are you getting enough vitamin D?"

However, the Council questioned her relationship status when she had two further children in 2010 and 2011 with different surnames. Fletcher Sanchez made a number of written statements insisting that she still lived alone. <br />  <br />  It was later discovered, as part of an investigation by the Council&rsquo;s Corporate Investigation Group, that Fletcher Sanchez had in fact married Mr Fabian Andres Restrepo Bonilla in Colombia in September 2010. Upon their return to the UK, they had lived together at Longridge Road. <br />  <br />  This prompted the Council to call Fletcher Sanchez in for an interview under caution in March 2014. During her interview Fletcher Sanchez exercised her right to make no comment but she did provide a written statement in which there was no mention of her husband. <br />  <br />  Sentencing Fletcher Sanchez, the magistrates said that because of her early guilty plea they would not be sending her case to Crown Court, where her sentence could have been greater. They also said that while the fraud was committed over a long period and involved a large sum of money her claim had not been fraudulent from the outset but that Fletcher Sanchez had provided false explanations. However, they had seen her references and the pre-sentence report and noted she was of previous good character. <br />  <br />  As a result of her making false statements in support of her Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit claim, Fletcher Sanchez received &pound;22,783.32 in Housing Benefit, &pound;2,023.78 in Council Tax Benefit and &pound;978.76 in Council Tax reduction to which she was not entitled. This overpayment stretched from September 2010 (when she got married) to May 2014. <br />  <br />  As well as the suspended custodial sentence a contribution to costs of &pound;750 was awarded, along with a victim surcharge of &pound;80 and unpaid work of 200 hours (the latter to be completed within 12 months).&nbsp;<br />  &nbsp;<br />  &nbsp;<br />  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","A woman who made false statements about her single parent status in a claim for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit was sentenced to six months custody, suspended for two years, at Hammersmith Magistrates Court (Wednesday 10 February 2015) after previously pleading guilty on 13 January 2015, at the same court, to five counts of dishonestly claiming Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. <br />","False claim to be a single parent leads to suspended sentence "

This commitment is in addition to all the usual statutory compensation and disturbance allowances. <br />  <br />  In addition the Council will try to offer all resident leaseholders on such an estate access to a shared equity scheme of the kind being piloted at Pembroke Road, to enable them to buy a home in a new development, even if it is worth more than their original home. This offer will depend on the viability of each regeneration project, but would also be in addition to all statutory compensation and disturbance allowances. <br />  <br />  These new commitments mean that existing communities would be kept together if and when regeneration projects go ahead, rather than being displaced and dispersed as happened in some historic examples. <br />  <br />  Explaining the principles behind these commitments Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen, Deputy Leader of the Council and Cabinet Member for Housing, Property and Regeneration, said: &ldquo;Despite austerity the Council still has many ambitions for the future of this borough. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;One of the most important is housing and the regeneration of some Council estates. We want the best possible homes for our existing and future tenants. We want more affordable homes, especially for those on low to middle incomes, who have been squeezed out of the private market but are ineligible for social rented housing. We want to preserve and strengthen our mixed communities that have made Kensington and Chelsea such an attractive place to live for people of all backgrounds. We want to tackle the causes of deprivation in some of our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. And we want to build new homes that will be considered beautiful and desirable for generations to come. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;This is all achievable and realistic, thanks to long years of careful financial stewardship by the Council and because of the underlying value and comparatively low densities of Council-owned land and housing. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;But this regeneration is something we want to do working with residents and these new commitments are all about showing tenants and leaseholders that we are serious about that.&rdquo; <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has agreed the principles it should aspire to when it comes to compensating and rehousing tenants and leaseholders affected by regeneration schemes on Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation managed estates. <br />","Redeveloping estates - Council commitment to tenants and leaseholders"

"6616","20/02/2015","Great services and low council tax to survive 2015-16","The Royal Borough&rsquo;s Cabinet last night (Thursday 19 February 2015) set its fifth austerity budget. <br />  <br />  Over the five year period, the Council&rsquo;s revenue budget will have shrunk by some &pound;48 million; a reduction primarily driven by falls in grants from central government. <br />  <br />  However, despite those falls, the council tax won&rsquo;t have increased at all; indeed 2015-16 will be the sixth year of continual freeze. And residents&rsquo; experience of services won&rsquo;t have changed significantly either. <br />  <br />  Maintaining the range and quality of services, and keeping the council tax the fifth lowest in the country, has been made possible by a radical austerity strategy adopted by the Cabinet from 2010 onwards. <br />  <br />  The strategy has three components: <br />  <br />  &bull; Sharing services, notably management, with our neighbouring boroughs. This will yield savings of &pound;12 million by the end of 2015-16; <br />  <br />  &bull; Traditional savings and efficiencies which in 2015-16 will amount to &pound;4 million and; <br />  <br />  &bull; Strong stewardship of our property estate. This is playing an increasingly important role in our strategy with the result that property income will rise to &pound;9.5 million in 2015-16 from &pound;3.8 million in 2010-11. <br />  <br />  The strategy of sharing, savings and stewardship has again enabled the Cabinet to protect Council services and actual service reductions will play no significant part in the 2015-16 budget, which will be debated by the full Council on 4 March and can be read online at www.rbkc.gov.uk <br />  <br />  At the same time, thanks to strong reserves built up over many years, the Cabinet is also able to move forward with a very ambitious capital programme to secure the future of Kensington and Chelsea. The projects include a new leisure centre opening in March 2015, the rebuilding and expansion of three primary schools, new affordable homes and new &lsquo;extra care&rsquo; housing for older residents. <br />  <br />  However as we start to pay some large bills on those projects the Council&rsquo;s reserves are forecast to shrink considerably, from &pound;160 million next year to &pound;105 million by 2018. <br />  <br />  Despite the good news contained in the Council budget, more years of austerity lie ahead. In his 2014 autumn statement, the Chancellor revealed that in order to continue to reduce the national deficit, large reductions in public spending will be necessary and it is likely that local government will again play a disproportionate role, mainly to protect funding for the National Health Service and for schools. <br />  <br />  The Council has anticipated this and has reduced spending not just in order to cope during this parliament but in order to be able to absorb the impact of a second phase of austerity after the general election. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;The three Ss of sharing, saving and stewardship have served our residents very well and are the best means of enabling us to face some further years of austerity with confidence,&rdquo; said Council Leader, Cllr Nick Paget-Brown. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;Along the way we have faced some testing decisions but those have so far been about doing things differently rather than not doing them at all. We mean that to stay the case for as long as we can possibly manage.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Despite the decision to continue the freeze on council tax, the Council in January ordered an exception to be made for homes that have been left empty for two years or more. From 1 April 2015 these will pay a 150 per cent rate. This will affect about 600 properties of a total of nearly 88,000 residential properties.&nbsp;<br />  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","The Royal Borough&rsquo;s Cabinet last night (Thursday 19 February 2015) set its fifth austerity budget. <br />","Great services and low council tax to survive 2015-16"

However the planning permission was granted subject to a planning condition that a Construction Traffic Management Plan be submitted and approved prior to the work beginning. The purpose of this condition was to ensure construction traffic did not unreasonably impact upon the local area. <br />  <br />  Following reports to the Council, planning enforcement department officers visited the site and were astonished to witness that the original property had been demolished and diggers were operating on the building site. <br />  <br />  Consequently, the officers issued both a Breach of Condition Notice and Temporary Stop Notice on the developers, Nu Build London Ltd, and the owners, Atraxia Developments Ltd on Monday 9 March 2015. <br />  <br />  The effect of these notices means any further development on site will be a criminal offence until a Construction Traffic Management Plan has been approved. Any conviction could lead to a maximum penalty of &pound;20,000 in a magistrates court and unlimited if heard in a crown court. <br />  <br />  Cllr Timothy Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: "Construction traffic from development is one of the biggest issues affecting residents in the borough. This is exactly why these planning conditions are imposed on both large- scale developments and basement developments. It is extraordinary that the developers, in this instance, either ignored the requirement of the planning condition or were negligent in ensuring that the planning condition had been complied with before works commenced. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;This is why our planning enforcement team have not hesitated to issue this Temporary Stop Notice.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Temporary Stop Notices are used sparingly by most local authorities.

As well as concerns about violence, hate crime and vehicle theft other issues raised included disturbance from noisy bars. There were also questions about how the authorities and how the borough plans to respond to harmful practices such as female genital mutilation. <br />  <br />  The audience heard from the police and Council about work being done by local voluntary and health organisations to deter youth crime and violence. Details were given about a project at St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital where youth workers talk to young people who have been injured as a result of crime. Important work is also being done by the police in local schools and youth clubs to get the message out about the true danger of carrying knives. <br />  <br />  Practical advice on how a mechanical lock, such as a krooklok, can deter car thieves was also given.<br />  &nbsp;<br />  The general feeling at the meeting was that residents are very grateful to the police and the Council&rsquo;s Community Safety team for all their hard work in keeping the borough a safe place to live and although there are still issues that concern them they understand that efforts are being made to tackle these problems. <br />  <br />  Residents were thanked for their attendance and questions. The police emphasised their reliance on information and intelligence from the public and urged people to report anything of concern, by calling the police on 101. Information can also be given anonymously to Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111. If a crime is taking place or someone is in immediate danger, always call 999. <br />  <br />  Member of the board, Cllr Joanna Gardner, Cabinet Member for Community Safety, IT and Corporate Services, said: &ldquo;It was wonderful to see so many residents at the first ever Safer Neighbourhood Board Annual General Meeting on Saturday. The AGM provided an opportunity for residents to find out more about the work of the board which has just completed its first year in operation; how the borough is policed and what the Council and police are doing to tackle crime. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;The voice of our community matters - and the feedback the board receives means that our residents are helping to set local policing priorities and monitor police performance. This means resources can be targeted so issues of local concern can be tackled and our communities are involved with problem solving and crime prevention.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  The Safer Neighbourhood Board will meet again in late July 2015, for more information and to attend go to www.kcsc.org.uk/network-forum/snb&nbsp;<br />  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","How best to tackle issues like hate crime, youth violence and vehicle theft were just some of the questions posed by borough residents to representatives from the Council and local police at the Kensington and Chelsea Safer Neighbourhood Board&rsquo;s Annual General Meeting. <br />","Council and police hear residents' concerns about crime and community safety"

VAWG training on how to embed learning from domestic homicide reviews was also observed. <br />  <br />  The delegation was especially interested to find out more about the strategic and operational approach of the VAWG partnership across the three boroughs including the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences, the specialist support services in the area, the response from the children and health sectors and the Domestic Abuse Housing Alliance. <br />  <br />  The Metropolitan Police Service&rsquo;s specialist Anti-Trafficking and Kidnap Unit hosted a morning to illustrate the impact of the Council-led initiative, the European Communities Against Trafficking (ECAT) Project which ran for two years up to December 2014 and was funded by the European Commission. <br />  <br />  Social Director in the Municipality of Karlstad Monica Persson said: "The Swedish delegation would like to thank the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for hosting our study visit in London. We were offered a fantastic programme that gave us a lot of new knowledge and inspiration within a broad variety of services and support in the borough concerning domestic violence and abuse. <br />  <br />  "All of the participants got a lot of input with regards to best practice and how valuable a strategic coordinated multi-agency community response is in order to tackle these issues. We are all impressed with the fantastic work being done around domestic violence and abuse in the three boroughs and everyone we met was incredibly professional and passionate about what they do.

"6676","15/05/2015","Fox Primary School gets ready for new beginning ","Work begins next week on the &pound;10 million expansion and refurbishment of the outstanding Fox Primary School. <br />  <br />  The high performing primary school in Notting Hill will become two-form entry, expanding from 315 to 420 pupils over seven years. The works will bring the building up to modern teaching and accessibility standards, new teacher training facilities will be available and running costs reduced. <br />  <br />  The first part of the project is the excavation of the unusable embankment to the west of the school, where the expanded building will be sited. <br />  <br />  When work is complete, Fox will have a new hall and interconnecting studio, which will be larger than the current hall and support a wide range of activities more easily. In addition, the classrooms will be rearranged to provide a more flexible and efficient use of space that meets current teaching needs. This will make it easier to provide group support to the most able pupils and also to those who find a particular topic difficult. <br />  <br />  Outside there will be a garden terrace which will provide the school with a quiet space and support ecology lessons. The children will be able to work on an allotment and the whole area will encourage bees and other wildlife. <br />  <br />  Welcoming the decision Councillor Emma Will, Cabinet Member for Education, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted that planning permission has been given for this much needed expansion and renovation of Fox Primary School. It is one of the top performing primary schools in England and the fact that more children will have the opportunity to be taught in such a high performing school is great news <br />  <br />  &ldquo;I am sure the children and staff will enjoy the new facilities they will have in 18 months time.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  To find out more and keep up to date on what is happening at Fox you can go to www.rbkc.gov.uk/foxprimary <br />  <br />  The work at Fox is part of a much larger investment by the Council in schools and infrastructure across the borough.

It will also design a new school for children with special educational needs on the same site. This will cater for children with speech, language and communication difficulties and also autism. The school, which will be for children aged from three to 19, will have respite facilities on site. The brief for Barlby Primary is to design a building with every modern facility including the latest in ICT technology. <br />  <br />  Adjoining Barlby Primary School is the Treverton Estate. This estate, and part of the Balfour of Burleigh estate, are in need of investment. As with the nearby Wornington Green and Silchester Garages developments, the Council believes there is an opportunity to improve the quality of Council homes available to existing and future tenants. All while providing additional new affordable homes for people on low and middle incomes, who are now priced out of buying or renting in the borough. <br />  <br />  The practice has a proven track record of working on residential-led and mixed-use projects. <br />  <br />  Speaking about the appointment, Cllr Rock Feilding-Mellen, Deputy Leader of the Council and Cabinet Member for Housing, Property and Regeneration, said: &ldquo;I very much look forward to working with bptw architecture and seeing the options it produces for this part of North Kensington.

You can&rsquo;t see it, smell it or even taste it on food, but if it affects you, you won&rsquo;t forget it. At its worst campylobacter can kill or paralyse. <br />  <br />  Campylobacter food poisoning usually develops a few days after eating contaminated food and leads to symptoms that include abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea and, sometimes, vomiting. <br />  <br />  Some cases can have lasting effects such as irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis and, in rare cases, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome &ndash; a serious condition of the nervous system. <br />  <br />  The FSA wants to cut the number of cases of campylobacter poisoning in half by the end of 2015. It could mean that over a hundred thousand fewer people would get sick next year. If everyone does their bit, including industry and consumers, this can happen. <br />  <br />  The FSA is advising everyone to step up to the plate and promise to: <br />  <br />  &bull; bag and store raw chicken separately from other food, covered and chilled on the bottom shelf of the fridge <br />  <br />  &bull; not to wash raw chicken as it splashes germs <br />  <br />  &bull; wash everything that&rsquo;s touched raw chicken in soap and hot water &ndash; your hands and utensils <br />  <br />  &bull; check chicken is cooked properly &ndash; no pink meat, steaming hot and the juices run clear. <br />  <br />  You can find out more at: www.food.gov.uk/chickenchallenge <br />  <br />  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that we all love chicken, we just need to take the time and be even more committed to ensuring we do the little things in the kitchen to keep our loved ones safe.&rdquo; said Nina Purcell, FSA Director. <br />  <br />  Cllr Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environmental Health, said: &ldquo;There are some simple steps we can all take to reduce the risk of a nasty bout of food poisoning brought about by the campylobacter germ.

An impressive 95 per cent of the borough's schools have been assessed as being 'good' or 'outstanding'. This is well above the national average of 81 per cent published by Ofsted in December 2014, and places the borough as one of the top local authorities in the country. <br />  <br />  Results for GCSEs, A levels and Key Stage 2 regularly place pupils and students attending borough schools close to the top of national league tables. Exam results for children who receive free school meals in the Royal Borough are amongst the very best in the country. Those eligible for free school meals receive funding known as the Pupil Premium. In 2014 the difference in Kensington and Chelsea between those who receive free school meals and those who do not was down to eight per cent, from 13 per cent in 2013, compared with 17 per cent nationally in 2014. <br />  <br />  With such high performing schools the demand for places at both primary and secondary remain high. In recent years the Council has embarked on an ambitious school building and expansion programme. This has seen Holland Park School completely rebuilt and two brand new academies built in the borough - the Chelsea Academy and the Kensington Aldridge Academy. There are advanced plans for a brand new primary school as well as extensive expansion and rebuilding projects for many of the borough's primaries. <br />  <br />  Councillor Emma Will, Cabinet Member for Education, said: "This is good news for parents. I am very pleased that, when taken as a whole, the high standard of education that we all want to see our children receive is available from so many of our schools.

Add to that the high turnover of residents and it&rsquo;s easy to see why some of the key messages about recycling and the right days to place rubbish out for collection are often either missed or ignored which can lead to waste being put in the wrong bags and spillages. <br />  <br />  The crew will often find waste is not bagged correctly, which means it has to clean up spillages and detritus left behind. All the collections it deals with are bagged waste, usually stored in old coal sheds in basements. These stores have low ceilings, confined space and poor visibility which all add to the task. <br />  <br />  Under the supervision of its team leader K7 sets out to tackle these issues head on. A combination of regular meetings to discuss problems on the round and a personal touch when it comes to dealing with complaints means the crew get to know as many residents as it can and can talk through issues soon after they arise. <br />  Last year K7 collected domestic waste and co-mingled recycling on nearly 500,000 occasions, and received very few complaints. <br />  <br />  K7&rsquo;s personal touch has seen it refine its round to serve the needs of one particular elderly lady with mobility issues and it&rsquo;s not unknown for residents to bring the team treats by way of cakes and hot drinks, which are always welcomed! <br />  <br />  Cllr Tim Ahern, Cabinet Member for Environment, said: &ldquo;Congratulations to the K7 crew.

That is not to say the matches were easy, but rather that the team spirit and mental focus was exemplary throughout the day. <br />  <br />  It has been a long and thrilling journey for Fox school. <br />  <br />  Firstly, the team had to progress via the central London qualification process, this they did in style. Secondly, came qualification at the All London Jack Petchey Championships where, despite losing their number one player at the semi-final stage, they still managed to qualify in second place behind Barnes Primary. <br />  <br />  Then, came the highly exacting process of getting through the South of England Championships in Bristol. This they managed to do in the very last game of the tournament. <br />  <br />  All was then set to take on the other three top table tennis primary schools teams in the country: Cliffedale Primary from Lincolnshire, Great Wood Primary from Lancashire and their old South London sparring partners from Barnes. <br />  <br />  Of course any victory in any sporting arena has as much to do with what happens in the weeks, months and years leading up to victory as to what happens on the day. <br />  <br />  Fox&rsquo;s table tennis club have had the unswerving support over many years of Head Teacher Paul Cotter and Sports Co-ordinator Ollie Millett. Credit also goes to the school&rsquo;s Child Welfare Office Maggie Curran, who in addition to her regular duties stepped in on the day and provided what proved to be decisive coaching interventions. <br />  <br />  Thanks must also go to former Fox parents, Anna Lisa, Amanda and Susan for setting up the extra high level training sessions at the Fox school. Without these sessions it is doubtful the Year 6 girls would have reached their all-conquering abilities. <br />  <br />  Finally the players were very ably supported by their parents and carers who tirelessly got their youngsters to where they need to be, whilst providing great support to the whole team throughout the many tournaments. <br />  <br />  Cllr Emma Will, Cabinet Member for Education, said: &ldquo;Fox school is renowned for its teaching and learning programmes now it can add the National Table Tennis Championships to its long list of achievements. Hearty congratulations to Laura, Eva, Rose, Nadia and Valentina for doing us proud. Well done girls!

Curated and produced by O&rsquo;Neill/Ross, the festival reflects the rise of site-responsive art in the UK emerging over the past nine years as an innovative platform for experimentation and new collaborations in art and performance. <br />  <br />  This year&rsquo;s highlights include MOBO and BAFTA award-winning hip-hop artist, &lsquo;Akala&rsquo; performing the first ever site-specific adaptation of his graphic novel The Ruins of Empires in the intimate surroundings of The Dissenters Chapel, Kensal Green Cemetery; the legendary birdmen of Mexico soaring through the air suspended on ropes from a 20-metre pole erected in Emslie Horniman&rsquo;s Pleasance; an urban beach under the Westway Flyover to mark the 50th anniversary of the National Trust Neptune Coastline Campaign and a Pop-Up Art School in Powis Square, where visitors can collaborate with artists and architects &ndash; part of the London Festival of Architecture. <br />  <br />  InTRANSIT Festival celebrates space and challenges the role of audiences by putting local residents at the heart of art commissioning. Using the rich array of public spaces, architectural treasures and world-class arts organisations based within the borough, this ten-day festival presents over twenty different productions and installations that are guaranteed to excite, challenge and surprise. <br />  <br />  After the success of the InTRANSIT Festival 2014, production and design team O&rsquo;Neill/Ross return to curate this year's festival.

Residents and visitors alike can enjoy a diverse programme of contemporary arts and culture, music and performance.

Whether your idea of paradise is wild or constructed, the story of utopia in the urban landscape is undoubtedly one of cultivation; humans striving to construct and put in place some reality that they deem to be an improvement on the current situation. It is always a pleasure working with the Royal Borough&rsquo;s Arts Service to present so many artists as they respond variedly to the idea of utopia, and all the beauty and folly that attends our struggle for a world beyond our own.&rdquo; <br />  <br />  Copies of the festival programme can be picked up locally from Kensington and Chelsea libraries, the town halls, and local arts venues including The Tabernacle and Chelsea Theatre. <br />  <br />  <br />  To find out more about the 2015 InTRANSIT Festival programme go to www.intransitfestival.co.uk <br />  <br />  Follow InTRANSIT Festival on Twitter @RBKCculture @intransitfest #InTRANSITFestival and Facebook InTRANSITFestival for the latest news and updates. <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","A dazzling programme of theatre, dance, art and music will take over the streets and iconic buildings of Kensington and Chelsea this summer with the return of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s InTRANSIT Festival (from Friday 19 to Sunday 28 June).

"6696","02/06/2015","Fairer charges for pavement tables and chairs","The cost of a licence to place tables and chairs on a pavement in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea changed in April after the Council opted to move away from a flat fee. <br />  <br />  The new arrangements mean the cost of a licence will now depend on how many tables and chairs the business owner wants to place on the pavement and whether the tables and chairs will be placed out in the evening. <br />  <br />  This will be good news for smaller businesses which only want a few tables and chairs outside. <br />  <br />  The ability for the Council to move away from a flat rate fee was obtained after it persuaded Parliament to amend the regulations governing highways licences. <br />  <br />  Previously it cost &pound;875 for a licence. Now the licence will cost &pound;485 with an additional charge of &pound;18 per chair. <br />  <br />  Councillor Tim Coleridge, Cabinet Member for Planning Policy and Transport, said: &ldquo;Many people enjoy the al fresco drinking and dining on offer in the borough. The licence plays an important part in allowing us to make this possible while at the same time ensuring our pavements do not become an obstacle course. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;This move away from one flat fee will be good news for those businesses that perhaps only have room to place one or two tables outside.&rdquo; <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","The cost of a licence to place tables and chairs on a pavement in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea changed in April after the Council opted to move away from a flat fee. <br />","Fairer charges for pavement tables and chairs"
"6697","05/06/2015","Record number of residents think the Council is doing a good job","A record number of Royal Borough residents think that the Council is doing a good job and that the borough is a great place to live according to our annual survey of residents. <br />  <br />  The survey sets out to record just what people who live in the Royal Borough think about the services they receive, their local environment and a range of other important issues such as crime, jobs and council tax and compares this with the results from the Annual Survey of Londoners. <br />  <br />  This year 86 per cent of Kensington and Chelsea residents said they were satisfied with the way the Council was run, which is the highest satisfaction rating it has ever received since the survey began in 2007 and compares with just 70 per cent of Londoners. <br />  <br />  An even higher 95 per cent thought the borough was a good place to live in. <br />  <br />  The Council continues to perform well compared with London as a whole with Kensington and Chelsea residents more satisfied with services such as street cleaning, street lighting, policing and repair of roads and pavements. Residents are also more positive about the Council doing a good job, being efficient and well run and providing value for money than other Londoners. <br />  <br />  The percentage of residents agreeing that the Council involves them when making decisions, has staff that are friendly and polite, and that the Council is doing a good job all significantly increased this year although there was also increased concern that the Council is difficult to get through to on the phone. <br />  <br />  Lack of affordable housing, traffic congestion and litter on the streets continue to be the key concerns for people who live in the borough. <br />  <br />  Concern about crime continues to decline and is much less than in London generally. Concern about lack of jobs, not enough being done for young people and the level of council tax also declined this year but there was an increase in concern about the number of homeless people. <br />  <br />  Commenting on the survey, Councillor Nick Paget-Brown, Leader of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, said: &ldquo;I am very pleased to read that, despite the enormous financial challenges we have faced, so many residents think we&rsquo;re doing a good job for them. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;This reflects well on all the hard working officers who deliver consistently good services to our residents. <br />  <br />  &ldquo;While such complimentary figures do provide a warm glow I know we must continue to work very hard indeed to make sure our high standards are maintained.

"6698","04/06/2015","Basement company fined for unauthorised advertising","A basement construction company pleaded guilty this week (Tuesday 2 June) at Hammersmith Magistrates&rsquo; Court to eleven charges of the display of unauthorised advertising boards and shrouds at two properties in Scarsdale Villas, W8. <br />  <br />  Large adverts for London Basement Ltd were displayed at 72 and 44 Scarsdale Villas in Kensington, where the company was carrying out basement extensions for the homeowners. <br />  <br />  There were 22 adverts on 72 Scarsdale Villas with an aggregate size of 42 square metres and five adverts on 44 Scarsdale Villas with an aggregate size of six square metres. <br />  <br />  It is a criminal offence for a developer to display more than one advert on a building site in a conservation area unless it first receives consent from the local council. Furthermore, the advert can be no greater than two metres square in area. <br />  <br />  The company was warned in May 2014, by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s Planning Enforcement Team, to remove all unauthorised adverts from within the borough or face prosecution. The company did so but was witnessed displaying unauthorised advertisements on dates between September 2014 and March 2015. <br />  <br />  The court heard how the company had no previous convictions and had taken steps to ensure advertisements on other sites it was working on complied with all regulations. Magistrates gave the company credit for its early guilty plea before fining it &pound;12,334 for the offences, imposed costs of &pound;2,980 and ordered the developer to pay a victim surcharge of &pound;120. <br />  <br />  Councillor Timothy Coleridge, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea&rsquo;s Cabinet Member for Planning Policy, said: &ldquo;We will not allow developers to advertise themselves illegally in our residential areas.

"6702","12/06/2015","New base for Adult Social Care in North Kensington","The Royal Borough&rsquo;s Cabinet last night approved plans to refurbish and modernise the former Kensington &amp; Chelsea College building at Maxilla Walk in North Kensington to provide a new base for Adult Social Care services and voluntary organisations. <br />  <br />  Once complete, the extensively remodelled and refurbished building will be home to the Learning Disability Day Service and two mental health day services. It will also provide high quality lettable office and meeting room space for voluntary organisations and some new Council accommodation as well. <br />  <br />  All the occupants will benefit from new meeting and training rooms, a new kitchen, caf&eacute; and garden. <br />  <br />  Not only will the project deliver a giant improvement in accommodation for a wide range of users, it will also enable 1-9 St Mark&rsquo;s Road and Unit 3 at Trellick Tower to be used for other purposes, including income generation to help maintain front line services. Both buildings are currently out of date, expensive to run and fail to meet modern accessibility standards. <br />  <br />  Following last night&rsquo;s decision, processes will now get underway to appoint a design team and contractor and consult local people. Subject to planning consent, it is anticipated the project will complete in autumn 2017. <br />  <br />  Councillor Mary Weale, Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care and Public Health, said: &ldquo;We believe co-locating these complementary services in purpose built accommodation will improve the quality of services and save money which we can use to protect those self same services.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />  <br />","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","Please Select","The Royal Borough&rsquo;s Cabinet last night approved plans to refurbish and modernise the former Kensington &amp; Chelsea College building at Maxilla Walk in North Kensington to provide a new base for Adult Social Care services and voluntary organisations. <br />","New base for Adult Social Care in North Kensington"
